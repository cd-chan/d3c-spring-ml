These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they’d discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.

In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.

“We thought it was going to be something that was unusual,” said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. “But it seems now like it’s coming pretty fast and furious.”

The speed and scope of the federal government’s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.

At least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.

Students apparently targeted over minor infractions

Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year — a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.

AP AUDIO: Visa cancellations sow panic for international students, with hundreds fearing deportation AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports visa cancellations are causing fear for some international students.

Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.

Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.

“We don’t know, and that’s the scary part,” he said.

The students were informed of the status terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a “criminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,” Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn’t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.

Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.

But many students say they don’t fall under those categories. Students have filed lawsuits in several states, arguing they were denied due process.

In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Wisconsin issued a similar order, ruling the government could not take steps to detain or revoke the visa of a University of Wisconsin-Madison gradate student.

Two graduate students at Montana State University, Bozeman, on Tuesday were granted a temporary restraining order by a federal judge in Montana, restoring their terminated legal status and shielding them from efforts to remove them from the U.S.

In a break from past, feds cancel students’ status directly

At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.

The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.

“You don’t need more than a small number to create fear,” Aw said. “There’s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.”

Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.

The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.

Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.

Still others caught in legal limbo aren’t students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on “optional practical training,” a one-year period — or up to three for science and technology graduates — that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.

Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this “optional practical training.” About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.

Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.

“We have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,” said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.

“These are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,” he said. “They’ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren’t hiding. They’re in school.”

Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.

A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university’s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.

“That is the most scary part because you don’t know whether you’re going to be the next person,” she said. ___

https://www.justsecurity.org/109069/u-s-ai-driven-catch-and-revoke-initiative-threatens-first-amendment-rights/,U.S. AI-Driven “Catch and Revoke” Initiative Threatens First Amendment Rights,"On March 8, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on the university’s campus. They claimed that Khalil’s student visa had both been revoked and when told that he had a green card, said that too had been revoked. While the full facts of the case are yet to emerge, there seems little doubt that Khalil was detained in retaliation for his activism. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently and explicitly threatened to go after university protestors, including in his Executive Order on “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,” which I analyzed in an earlier post. Trump celebrated Khalil’s arrest on social media, warning that it was the first “of many to come.”

Some of the “many to come” will likely be identified via the State Department’s newly launched AI-enabled “Catch and Revoke” initiative, which will scrape social media to find “foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups” and cancel their visas. Like the executive order cited above, this effort is framed as an anti-terrorism measure. Instead, it is being used to terrorize foreigners and to dissuade people from participating in First Amendment-protected activity for fear that they too will be targeted in some way.

Starting with the Obama administration, the federal government has built an extensive infrastructure for agencies to comb social media looking for certain types of speech. Even as civil society groups have raised concerns about how these programs could be used to target unpopular speech, they have continued to proliferate.

The State Department, for example, collects social media handles from certain types of visa applicants — some 14 million people a year — which are saved indefinitely in government databases. (The Brennan Center, where I work, and the Knight Institute have challenged this program in court.) The second Trump administration is aiming to dramatically expand these efforts, collecting social media identifiers from an additional 33 million people, including those applying for permanent residence or adjustment of their immigration status. The first Trump administration’s attempt to do so was blocked in 2021 by the Biden White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on the grounds that the government had not demonstrated “the practical utility of collecting this information.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) runs at least 12 overlapping programs that track what Americans say online, several of which are focused on protests. DHS used social media to track protests against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies. During the Biden administration, DHS scanned social media for other targets, such as Americans discussing abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and trucker convoys protesting Covid-19 mandates, as well as broadly monitoring online “narratives and grievances” —i.e., people talking politics.

Even as it adds more and more social media monitoring programs to its repertoire, the government has never shown that these efforts are effective. A February 2017 DHS Inspector General audit of six pilot programs found that the department had not even measured their effectiveness. And the few government evaluations that are publicly available undermine any governmental claims of efficacy. A brief prepared by DHS for the first Trump administration concluded that social media monitoring did not provide useful information for vetting refugees. And, according to a 2021 analysis by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, social media identifiers added “no value” to the immigration screening and vetting process.

Looking for unknown foreign protestors who may have made ostensibly pro-terrorist statements is much harder than vetting the posts of a known person, such as a visa applicant. It will undoubtedly sweep far too broadly and result in mistakes. The AI tools that will be deployed by the State Department likely will be tasked to search for specific words or phrases. The Trump administration has used these types of lists in its attempt to root out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the federal government, resulting in various blunders. In one instance, a federal employee who managed relations with private equity-held businesses was placed on administrative leave “pursuant to the President’s executive order on DEIA.” The Internal Revenue Service purged its employee manual of references to the “inequity” of holding on to taxpayer money longer than necessary and the “inclusion” of a taxpayer identification number on a form. The Defense Department flagged for deletion mentions of the World War II Enola Gay aircraft and references to people who have the last name “Gay.”

Even without mistakes, broad social media monitoring will have enormous First Amendment consequences. The types of speech that the administration has declared it intends to target is exceptionally broad. In defending his arrest, DHS said Khalil led activities “aligned” with Hamas, a term untethered to any law or regulation. Statements from Trump and his cabinet characterize foreigners who are in the administration’s crosshairs as “pro-Hamas” (most common), “pro-terrorist,” “terrorist sympathizers,” people who “support terrorism,” and “anti-Semitic.” These are broad and contested terms. Pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel sentiments have often been conflated with anti-Semitism or pro-terrorism, leaving a broad swath of people vulnerable to being caught in an AI-enabled social media net.

The Trump administration’s efforts ultimately may sweep even more broadly, seeking out speech that it views as anti-American. The vetting executive order instructed the Secretary of State to recommend measures for foreign nationals who call for the “overthrow or replacement of the culture on which our constitutional Republic stands.” In addition, the sole justification provided by the administration for acting against Khalil is a single line in the Notice to Appear in immigration court: “The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse policy consequences for the foreign policy of the United States,” citing 237(A)(4)(c)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” As Adam Cox and Ahilan Arulanantham explained on Just Security, this provision cannot be read as a blank check for the administration to deport people based on an unarticulated foreign policy rationale. But if the administration wants to deport foreigners who take positions contrary to U.S. foreign policy, they will certainly find plenty of fodder on social media.

Khalil’s case and the Trump administration’s promise to go after foreign protestors for their social media posts is an extraordinary assertion of executive power over immigrants living in the United States. But it should not be viewed in isolation. It is part of Trump’s broader effort to subdue all potential sources of opposition by attacking universities, the press, law firms, and jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with ICE. All of these endanger the fundamental constitutional promise of a democratic society in which a multitude of views and interests can be freely expressed.

https://sahanjournal.com/education/international-students-data-collection-ice-arrests/,How the government collects and uses data on international students,"The recent arrests of two international students in Minnesota and stripping of legal student status from five others have raised widespread alarm and questions about the legality of such actions across the country.

Part of the federal strategy is not new. Immigration authorities require schools to share information about their international students, and have legally monitored students’ social media accounts for several years, Minnesota immigration attorneys say. But arresting them or ordering them to self-deport based on their political views and presence at protests steps into unclear legal territory, they say.

While some international students have been arrested in other states for political activism, the March 27 arrest of a University of Minnesota student was likely linked to a drunken driving conviction and not political speech, the student’s attorney wrote in a lawsuit filed against government officials.

It’s unknown why an international student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, was arrested on March 28, or why five other international students at the school had their legal student status revoked.

Here’s how the federal monitoring system works: When an international student obtains a visa to study in the United States, their personal information is logged into a federal database. In 2019, applications for international student visas began asking students to include information about their social media accounts.

Immigration authorities “have the whole international student database at their fingertips,” said Craig Peterson, an immigration attorney.

Another database, called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), keeps track of international students. Schools with international students are required to log their names, addresses, email addresses, country of citizenship and the number of classes they’re taking.

Schools are also asked to report passport numbers, the airport students arrive at and their dates of entry into the United States.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can check the database to learn about an international student’s visa status, said Ana Pottratz Acosta, an immigration attorney who teaches at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul.

“The difference here is that their social media monitoring appears to be checks of social media for political speech that has historically been protected by the First Amendment,” she said.

An international student’s status can be terminated on SEVIS for a variety of reasons, including expulsion from school, not being enrolled as a full-time student or unauthorized work, said Minnetonka immigration attorney Steven Thal.

A student’s status on SEVIS is different from their visa, Pottratz Acosta said. A student visa allows an international student to enter the United States, but once they arrive, it is their student status, rather than their visa, that determines whether they can stay lawfully.

Schools don’t report students’ criminal charges or convictions to ICE, Peterson said. However, the federal government reviews criminal data available through the court system, and cross references it with information on international students in SEVIS.

If an international student commits a crime that is considered a removable offense under immigration law, their visa can be revoked and they can be deported, Pottratz Acosta said. If that occurs, school officials do not automatically cancel a student’s status on SEVIS. But it’s possible that an international student can have their visa revoked and SEVIS status terminated at the same time.

When a student’s status is terminated on SEVIS, they are expected to either request reinstatement or immediately leave the country, according to Study in the States, a DHS website.

Minnesota arrests

Doğukan Günaydın, the University of Minnesota student from Turkey arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week, did not participate in protests or write any political articles, according to his lawsuit. He is asking a federal judge for release from custody and reinstatement of his student status.

When he was arrested, his lawsuit states, his student status on SEVIS was still active. But seven hours after his arrest, a DHS official terminated that status, thereby removing his ability to stay in the United States.

Günaydın was apparently targeted because of a June 2023 arrest in Minneapolis for driving with a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit of .08. He pleaded guilty, according to his lawsuit.

“What the lawsuit is going to have to be about is whether ICE can, on the basis of a DUI, cancel your SEVIS record and thereby destroy your legal status in the United States and render you removable,” Peterson said.

The Mankato student who was arrested last week had a valid student visa at the time, according to a statement from Students United, an advocacy nonprofit representing seven state universities. Their identity has not been publicly released.

‘Atmosphere of fear’

Some recent arrests of international students, including at Columbia University in New York City and Tufts University in Massachusetts, were in response to their online political views and presence at protests, especially those related to the war in Gaza.

In those cases, ICE officials could have used photos from protests, social media posts and bylined opinion articles as evidence that the government claims could lead to deportation, Peterson said.

Judges will have to decide whether those arrests violated the students’ First Amendment rights, immigration attorneys say.

“We do see the current administration really trying to ignore those [constitutional rights] and rush through their enforcement processes before the courts have an opportunity to react,” Peterson said.

He recommends that international students carry their passport on them at all times, or their I-20, a document that certifies their admission to a school and enables them to have a visa.

Some universities are advising international students who are currently in countries listed under a proposed travel ban to return to the United States, according to NAFSA, a nonprofit dedicated to international education. They’re also recommending that students refrain from traveling to those countries.

More than 40 countries, including Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela, are listed in the proposed travel ban, according to the New York Times.

“A lot of things are happening very rapidly, and it seems as though the goal is to create an atmosphere of fear by a lot of people so that it will silence any action or political speech that is viewed negatively by the Trump administration,” Pottratz Acosta said. “I think that is a bigger problem than simply looking at targeted actions against international students. It has far greater implications.”

If approached by an ICE agent, an international student has the right to remain silent, Thal said. International students can also apply for other visas if they are eligible and their current visa is revoked, he added.

Students United also recommends that international students check their visas frequently and stay updated on changes with their country of origin and the United States."

BBC

For the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres. Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a ""privilege"" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons. But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector. For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students. The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC. ""I could be next,"" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza. He's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement. Another student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries. And at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US. Most students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target. The BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.

His detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana. Last Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa. ""Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,"" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri. The White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that ""run counter"" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy. In a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the ""ringleader of chaos"" at the university.

Polling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating. Universities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to ""surrendering its independence"". Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?

Trump administration threatens Harvard with foreign student ban Trump officials have said that if Harvard doesn't comply with a request for information on certain student visaholders, it will stop granting visas to international students who want to study there. Georgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is ""silencing dissent"" by intimidating would-be protesters. The Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.

In addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest. ""I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,"" he said. Georgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi. ""This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,"" he said. At Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.
