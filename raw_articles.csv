These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they’d discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.

In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.

“We thought it was going to be something that was unusual,” said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. “But it seems now like it’s coming pretty fast and furious.”

The speed and scope of the federal government’s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.

At least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.

Students apparently targeted over minor infractions

Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year — a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.

AP AUDIO: Visa cancellations sow panic for international students, with hundreds fearing deportation AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports visa cancellations are causing fear for some international students.

Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.

Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.

“We don’t know, and that’s the scary part,” he said.

The students were informed of the status terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a “criminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,” Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn’t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.

Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.

But many students say they don’t fall under those categories. Students have filed lawsuits in several states, arguing they were denied due process.

In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Wisconsin issued a similar order, ruling the government could not take steps to detain or revoke the visa of a University of Wisconsin-Madison gradate student.

Two graduate students at Montana State University, Bozeman, on Tuesday were granted a temporary restraining order by a federal judge in Montana, restoring their terminated legal status and shielding them from efforts to remove them from the U.S.

In a break from past, feds cancel students’ status directly

At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.

The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.

“You don’t need more than a small number to create fear,” Aw said. “There’s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.”

Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.

The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.

Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.

Still others caught in legal limbo aren’t students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on “optional practical training,” a one-year period — or up to three for science and technology graduates — that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.

Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this “optional practical training.” About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.

Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.

“We have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,” said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.

“These are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,” he said. “They’ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren’t hiding. They’re in school.”

Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.

A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university’s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.

“That is the most scary part because you don’t know whether you’re going to be the next person,” she said. ___

https://www.justsecurity.org/109069/u-s-ai-driven-catch-and-revoke-initiative-threatens-first-amendment-rights/,U.S. AI-Driven “Catch and Revoke” Initiative Threatens First Amendment Rights,"On March 8, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on the university’s campus. They claimed that Khalil’s student visa had both been revoked and when told that he had a green card, said that too had been revoked. While the full facts of the case are yet to emerge, there seems little doubt that Khalil was detained in retaliation for his activism. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently and explicitly threatened to go after university protestors, including in his Executive Order on “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,” which I analyzed in an earlier post. Trump celebrated Khalil’s arrest on social media, warning that it was the first “of many to come.”

Some of the “many to come” will likely be identified via the State Department’s newly launched AI-enabled “Catch and Revoke” initiative, which will scrape social media to find “foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups” and cancel their visas. Like the executive order cited above, this effort is framed as an anti-terrorism measure. Instead, it is being used to terrorize foreigners and to dissuade people from participating in First Amendment-protected activity for fear that they too will be targeted in some way.

Starting with the Obama administration, the federal government has built an extensive infrastructure for agencies to comb social media looking for certain types of speech. Even as civil society groups have raised concerns about how these programs could be used to target unpopular speech, they have continued to proliferate.

The State Department, for example, collects social media handles from certain types of visa applicants — some 14 million people a year — which are saved indefinitely in government databases. (The Brennan Center, where I work, and the Knight Institute have challenged this program in court.) The second Trump administration is aiming to dramatically expand these efforts, collecting social media identifiers from an additional 33 million people, including those applying for permanent residence or adjustment of their immigration status. The first Trump administration’s attempt to do so was blocked in 2021 by the Biden White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on the grounds that the government had not demonstrated “the practical utility of collecting this information.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) runs at least 12 overlapping programs that track what Americans say online, several of which are focused on protests. DHS used social media to track protests against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies. During the Biden administration, DHS scanned social media for other targets, such as Americans discussing abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and trucker convoys protesting Covid-19 mandates, as well as broadly monitoring online “narratives and grievances” —i.e., people talking politics.

Even as it adds more and more social media monitoring programs to its repertoire, the government has never shown that these efforts are effective. A February 2017 DHS Inspector General audit of six pilot programs found that the department had not even measured their effectiveness. And the few government evaluations that are publicly available undermine any governmental claims of efficacy. A brief prepared by DHS for the first Trump administration concluded that social media monitoring did not provide useful information for vetting refugees. And, according to a 2021 analysis by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, social media identifiers added “no value” to the immigration screening and vetting process.

Looking for unknown foreign protestors who may have made ostensibly pro-terrorist statements is much harder than vetting the posts of a known person, such as a visa applicant. It will undoubtedly sweep far too broadly and result in mistakes. The AI tools that will be deployed by the State Department likely will be tasked to search for specific words or phrases. The Trump administration has used these types of lists in its attempt to root out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the federal government, resulting in various blunders. In one instance, a federal employee who managed relations with private equity-held businesses was placed on administrative leave “pursuant to the President’s executive order on DEIA.” The Internal Revenue Service purged its employee manual of references to the “inequity” of holding on to taxpayer money longer than necessary and the “inclusion” of a taxpayer identification number on a form. The Defense Department flagged for deletion mentions of the World War II Enola Gay aircraft and references to people who have the last name “Gay.”

Even without mistakes, broad social media monitoring will have enormous First Amendment consequences. The types of speech that the administration has declared it intends to target is exceptionally broad. In defending his arrest, DHS said Khalil led activities “aligned” with Hamas, a term untethered to any law or regulation. Statements from Trump and his cabinet characterize foreigners who are in the administration’s crosshairs as “pro-Hamas” (most common), “pro-terrorist,” “terrorist sympathizers,” people who “support terrorism,” and “anti-Semitic.” These are broad and contested terms. Pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel sentiments have often been conflated with anti-Semitism or pro-terrorism, leaving a broad swath of people vulnerable to being caught in an AI-enabled social media net.

The Trump administration’s efforts ultimately may sweep even more broadly, seeking out speech that it views as anti-American. The vetting executive order instructed the Secretary of State to recommend measures for foreign nationals who call for the “overthrow or replacement of the culture on which our constitutional Republic stands.” In addition, the sole justification provided by the administration for acting against Khalil is a single line in the Notice to Appear in immigration court: “The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse policy consequences for the foreign policy of the United States,” citing 237(A)(4)(c)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” As Adam Cox and Ahilan Arulanantham explained on Just Security, this provision cannot be read as a blank check for the administration to deport people based on an unarticulated foreign policy rationale. But if the administration wants to deport foreigners who take positions contrary to U.S. foreign policy, they will certainly find plenty of fodder on social media.

Khalil’s case and the Trump administration’s promise to go after foreign protestors for their social media posts is an extraordinary assertion of executive power over immigrants living in the United States. But it should not be viewed in isolation. It is part of Trump’s broader effort to subdue all potential sources of opposition by attacking universities, the press, law firms, and jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with ICE. All of these endanger the fundamental constitutional promise of a democratic society in which a multitude of views and interests can be freely expressed.

https://sahanjournal.com/education/international-students-data-collection-ice-arrests/,How the government collects and uses data on international students,"The recent arrests of two international students in Minnesota and stripping of legal student status from five others have raised widespread alarm and questions about the legality of such actions across the country.

Part of the federal strategy is not new. Immigration authorities require schools to share information about their international students, and have legally monitored students’ social media accounts for several years, Minnesota immigration attorneys say. But arresting them or ordering them to self-deport based on their political views and presence at protests steps into unclear legal territory, they say.

While some international students have been arrested in other states for political activism, the March 27 arrest of a University of Minnesota student was likely linked to a drunken driving conviction and not political speech, the student’s attorney wrote in a lawsuit filed against government officials.

It’s unknown why an international student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, was arrested on March 28, or why five other international students at the school had their legal student status revoked.

Here’s how the federal monitoring system works: When an international student obtains a visa to study in the United States, their personal information is logged into a federal database. In 2019, applications for international student visas began asking students to include information about their social media accounts.

Immigration authorities “have the whole international student database at their fingertips,” said Craig Peterson, an immigration attorney.

Another database, called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), keeps track of international students. Schools with international students are required to log their names, addresses, email addresses, country of citizenship and the number of classes they’re taking.

Schools are also asked to report passport numbers, the airport students arrive at and their dates of entry into the United States.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can check the database to learn about an international student’s visa status, said Ana Pottratz Acosta, an immigration attorney who teaches at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul.

“The difference here is that their social media monitoring appears to be checks of social media for political speech that has historically been protected by the First Amendment,” she said.

An international student’s status can be terminated on SEVIS for a variety of reasons, including expulsion from school, not being enrolled as a full-time student or unauthorized work, said Minnetonka immigration attorney Steven Thal.

A student’s status on SEVIS is different from their visa, Pottratz Acosta said. A student visa allows an international student to enter the United States, but once they arrive, it is their student status, rather than their visa, that determines whether they can stay lawfully.

Schools don’t report students’ criminal charges or convictions to ICE, Peterson said. However, the federal government reviews criminal data available through the court system, and cross references it with information on international students in SEVIS.

If an international student commits a crime that is considered a removable offense under immigration law, their visa can be revoked and they can be deported, Pottratz Acosta said. If that occurs, school officials do not automatically cancel a student’s status on SEVIS. But it’s possible that an international student can have their visa revoked and SEVIS status terminated at the same time.

When a student’s status is terminated on SEVIS, they are expected to either request reinstatement or immediately leave the country, according to Study in the States, a DHS website.

Minnesota arrests

Doğukan Günaydın, the University of Minnesota student from Turkey arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week, did not participate in protests or write any political articles, according to his lawsuit. He is asking a federal judge for release from custody and reinstatement of his student status.

When he was arrested, his lawsuit states, his student status on SEVIS was still active. But seven hours after his arrest, a DHS official terminated that status, thereby removing his ability to stay in the United States.

Günaydın was apparently targeted because of a June 2023 arrest in Minneapolis for driving with a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit of .08. He pleaded guilty, according to his lawsuit.

“What the lawsuit is going to have to be about is whether ICE can, on the basis of a DUI, cancel your SEVIS record and thereby destroy your legal status in the United States and render you removable,” Peterson said.

The Mankato student who was arrested last week had a valid student visa at the time, according to a statement from Students United, an advocacy nonprofit representing seven state universities. Their identity has not been publicly released.

‘Atmosphere of fear’

Some recent arrests of international students, including at Columbia University in New York City and Tufts University in Massachusetts, were in response to their online political views and presence at protests, especially those related to the war in Gaza.

In those cases, ICE officials could have used photos from protests, social media posts and bylined opinion articles as evidence that the government claims could lead to deportation, Peterson said.

Judges will have to decide whether those arrests violated the students’ First Amendment rights, immigration attorneys say.

“We do see the current administration really trying to ignore those [constitutional rights] and rush through their enforcement processes before the courts have an opportunity to react,” Peterson said.

He recommends that international students carry their passport on them at all times, or their I-20, a document that certifies their admission to a school and enables them to have a visa.

Some universities are advising international students who are currently in countries listed under a proposed travel ban to return to the United States, according to NAFSA, a nonprofit dedicated to international education. They’re also recommending that students refrain from traveling to those countries.

More than 40 countries, including Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela, are listed in the proposed travel ban, according to the New York Times.

“A lot of things are happening very rapidly, and it seems as though the goal is to create an atmosphere of fear by a lot of people so that it will silence any action or political speech that is viewed negatively by the Trump administration,” Pottratz Acosta said. “I think that is a bigger problem than simply looking at targeted actions against international students. It has far greater implications.”

If approached by an ICE agent, an international student has the right to remain silent, Thal said. International students can also apply for other visas if they are eligible and their current visa is revoked, he added.

Students United also recommends that international students check their visas frequently and stay updated on changes with their country of origin and the United States."

BBC

For the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres. Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a ""privilege"" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons. But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector. For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students. The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC. ""I could be next,"" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza. He's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement. Another student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries. And at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US. Most students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target. The BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.

His detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana. Last Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa. ""Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,"" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri. The White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that ""run counter"" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy. In a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the ""ringleader of chaos"" at the university.

Polling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating. Universities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to ""surrendering its independence"". Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?

Georgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is ""silencing dissent"" by intimidating would-be protesters. The Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.

In addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest. ""I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,"" he said. Georgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi. ""This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,"" he said. At Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/05/16/ice-warns-international-students-more-sevis,ICE Warns International Students of More SEVIS Terminations,"Immigration officials sent letters to international students on short-term work visas Thursday night, threatening to terminate their legal status in the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System and remove them from the country. The number of affected students is still unknown, but Inside Higher Ed can confirm at least 35.

It’s the first sign that the Trump administration is resuming its campaign to deport student visa holders, weeks after restoring the statuses of thousands of students. ICE recently released an updated policy that significantly expands the agency’s authority to terminate students’ SEVIS status and pave the way for deportation proceedings.

This time, they’re targeting students on Optional Practical Training visas, or OPTs, which allow international postgraduates the opportunity to work in a field relevant to their study on a short-term extension. Students on OPT are allowed a total of 90 days of unemployment every 12 months before falling out of compliance. It’s still not known whether any of the affected students were on a special visa extension known as OPT for STEM, awarded to graduates in high-demand technology, science and engineering fields.

One international student adviser, who spoke with Inside Higher Ed on the condition of anonymity, said 28 of his institution’s students on OPT received the letter in the past day, and he expects that number will grow.

In a copy of one letter received by an international student and obtained by Inside Higher Ed, Immigration and Customs Enforcement warned those who have not reported employment status within 90 days of starting their OPT visa that they must do so in 15 days. If they don’t, the Student Exchange and Visitor Program “will set your SEVIS record to ‘terminated,’” the letter reads, which “may result in the initiation of immigration proceedings to remove you from the United States.”

The letter is nearly identical to those sent by officials during the first Trump administration in 2020. The only difference: Back then, the Student Exchange and Visitor Program was the letter’s sole signatory. This time, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are also named.

The 2020 letters were sent two years after officials issued an update to designated school officials informing them that the administration had begun a review of OPT students’ employment status to find noncompliant visa holders. But that notice also said SEVP would not automatically terminate students’ SEVIS status for going over the 90-day unemployment limit before notifying students.

It’s not clear whether immigration officials engaged in a review process before beginning to notify students of potential SEVIS terminations this week. Spokespeople for ICE and DHS did not respond to questions in time for publication.

It was also not immediately clear if OPT students’ SEVIS terminations would result in subsequent visa revocations, which are the purview of the State Department. A spokesperson for the State Department wrote in an email that they “cannot preview future visa-related decisions, which are made on a case-by-case basis, based on the individual facts relevant to the case,” and deferred other questions sent by Inside Higher Ed to DHS.

In an internal communication sent to international student advisers and support specialists, NAFSA, an organization of international educators, urged college officials to regularly check the SEVIS database for notices of OPT students’ compliance with “accrued unemployment days” and to reach out to any students who are over the 90-day limit as soon as possible.

Immigration officials began systematically terminating thousands of students’ SEVIS statuses along with their visas in late March, an unprecedented move that threw international student support offices into chaos and left students scrambling to avoid deportation.



Last month, immigration officials restored the SEVIS statuses of more than 5,000 international students after losing dozens of court cases challenging the legality of efforts to revoke foreign students’ legal residency at a breakneck pace.

The anonymous international student adviser said students on OPT often forget to report their employment details before the 90-day deadline. Many are distracted by graduations and finals well after they receive approval for the visa and forget, he said; in other cases, the lapse can be due to technical issues within SEVIS.

Because of that, they’re often given some leeway, and he said he’s never seen or heard of a student having their SEVIS status terminated for not reporting employment details on time, including the last time these letters were sent in 2020. Then again, much of the Trump administration’s treatment of student visa holders is unprecedented, and he’s worried this could be a real danger for them.

“There’s a lot of panic and uncertainty as our students are waiting to see what will happen, and we’re waiting to see if they’ll really go through with it,” he said. “I think this is the real deal.”"
https://apnews.com/article/international-student-status-restored-9e8a7cb90f4193ec52bf06edc5094cd9,ICE is reversing the termination of legal status for international students around the US,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The U.S. government is reversing the termination of legal status for international students around the country after many filed court challenges against the Trump administration crackdown, federal officials said Friday.

The records in a federal student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been terminated in recent weeks. Judges across the U.S. had already issued orders temporarily restoring students’ records in dozens of lawsuits challenging the terminations.

More than 1,200 students nationwide suddenly lost their legal status or had visas revoked, leaving them at risk for deportation. Many said they had only minor infractions on their record or did not know why they were targeted. Some left the country while others have gone into hiding or stopped going to class.

Government says it will restore student status

Word of the policy pivot came Friday from lawyers representing the government in several of the lawsuits.

A lawyer for the plaintiff in one of the lawsuits, Brian Green, provided The Associated Press with a copy of a statement a government lawyer emailed to him on the restoration of legal status for people whose records were recently terminated.

It says: “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.”

SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students’ compliance with their visa status. NCIC is the National Crime Information Center, a database of criminal justice information maintained by the FBI.

Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant Homeland Security secretary, said ICE had not reversed course on any visa revocations but did “restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked.”

Several colleges said Friday they noticed legal status already had been restored for some of their students, but uncertainty remained.

“It is still unclear whether ICE will restore status to everyone it has targeted and whether the State Department will help students whose visas were wrongly revoked,” said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Legal fights may not be over

Green, who is involved in lawsuits on behalf of several dozen students, said his cases only sought restoration of the student status and that he would be withdrawing them as a result of the statement Friday from ICE.

But lawyers in the Oakland case are seeking a nationwide order from the court prohibiting the government from arresting or incarcerating students, transferring them to places outside their district or preventing them from continuing work or studies.

Pam Johann, a government lawyer, said it was premature to consider anything like that given that ICE was in the process of reactivating records and developing a policy. “We should take a pause while ICE is implementing this change that plaintiffs are seeking right now, on its own,” she said.

But U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White asked her to humor the court.

“It seems like with this administration there’s a new world order every single day,” he said. “It’s like whack-a-mole.”

He ordered the government to clarify the new policy.

Visa revocations and student status terminations caused confusion

Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said his department was revoking visas held by people acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges. But many students whose status was terminated said they did not fall under those categories.

A survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs research found that even the visa revocations for students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests are more unpopular than popular. About half of U.S. adults oppose this policy, and only 3 in 10 are in support. Among college educated adults, 6 in 10 strongly oppose, compared with 4 in 10 who aren’t college graduates.

In lawsuits, students argued they were denied due process. Many were told that their status was terminated as a result of a criminal records check or that their visa had been revoked.

International students and their schools were caught off guard by the terminations of the students’ records. Many of the terminations were discovered when school officials were doing routine checks of the international student database.

Charles Kuck, who filed a case in Atlanta on behalf of 133 students across the country said ICE’s reversal can’t undo the distress and hardship they have faced in recent weeks.

“I’ve got kids who lost their jobs, who might not get them back,” he said. “I’ve got kids who lost school opportunities who might not get them back. We’ve got kids who missed finals, missed graduation. How do you get any of that stuff back?”

Jodie Ferise, a higher education attorney in Indiana, said some students at schools her law firm works with already left the country after receiving instructions to self-deport.

“This unprecedented treatment of student status had caused tremendous fear among international students,” Ferise said. “Some of them were too frightened to wait and hope for the administration to change course.”

Earlier this week, before the government’s reversal, Ferise said the situation could hurt international student enrollment.

“The world is watching, and we will lose students, not just by the technical revocation of their status, but by the message we’re sending that we don’t want them anyway and that it isn’t safe to even try to go to school here,” she said.

At least 1,220 students at 187 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked, their legal status terminated or both, since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP has been working to confirm reports of hundreds more students who are caught up in the crackdown.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/international-students-stripped-of-legal-status-in-the-u-s-are-piling-up-wins-in-court,International students stripped of legal status in the U.S. are piling up wins in court,"ATLANTA (AP) — Anjan Roy was studying with friends at Missouri State University when he got an email that turned his world upside down. His legal status as an international student had been terminated, and he was suddenly at risk for deportation.

“I was in literal shock, like, what the hell is this?” said Roy, a graduate student in computer science from Bangladesh.

At first, he avoided going out in public, skipping classes and mostly keeping his phone turned off. A court ruling in his favor led to his status being restored this week, and he has returned to his apartment, but he is still asking his roommates to screen visitors.

More than a thousand international students have faced similar disruptions in recent weeks, with their academic careers — and their lives in the U.S. — thrown into doubt in a widespread crackdown by the Trump administration. Some have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students’ legal status at least temporarily.

In addition to the case filed in Atlanta, where Roy is among 133 plaintiffs, judges have issued temporary restraining orders in states including New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Judges have denied similar requests in some other cases, saying it was not clear the loss of status would cause irreparable harm.

International students challenge grounds for their status revocation

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges. But many affected students said they have been involved only in minor infractions, or it’s unclear altogether why they were targeted.

The attorney for Roy and his fellow plaintiffs, Charles Kuck, argued the government did not have legal grounds to terminate the students’ status.

He speculated in court last week the government is trying to encourage these students to self-deport, saying “the pressure on these students is overwhelming.” He said some asked him if it was safe to leave their homes to get food, and others worried they wouldn’t receive a degree after years of work or feared their chances of a career in the U.S. were shot.

“I think the hope is they’ll just leave,” Kuck said. “The reality is these kids are invested.”

An attorney for the government, R. David Powell, argued the students did not suffer significant harm because they could transfer their academic credits or find jobs in another country.

At least 1,100 students at 174 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP is working to confirm reports of hundreds more students who are caught up in the crackdown.

In a lawsuit filed Monday by four people on student visas at the University of Iowa, attorneys detail the “mental and financial suffering” they’ve experienced. One graduate student, from India, “cannot sleep and is having difficulty breathing and eating,” the lawsuit reads. He has stopped going to school, doing research or working as a teaching assistant. Another student, a Chinese undergraduate who expected to graduate this December, said his revoked status has caused his depression to worsen to the point that his doctor increased his medication dosage. The student, the lawsuit says, has not left his apartment out of fear of detention.

Tiny infractions made students targets for the crackdown

Roy, 23, began his academic career at Missouri State in August 2024 as an undergraduate computer science student. He was active in the chess club and a fraternity and has a broad circle of friends. After graduating in December, he began work on a master’s degree in January and expects to finish in May 2026.

When Roy received the university’s April 10 email on his status termination, one of his friends offered to skip class to go with him to the school’s international services office, even though they had a quiz in 45 minutes. The staff there said a database check showed his student status had been terminated, but they didn’t know why.

Roy said his only brush with the law came in 2021, when he was questioned by campus security after someone called in a dispute at a university housing building. But he said an officer determined there was no evidence of any crime and no charges were filed.

Roy also got an email from the U.S. embassy in Bangladesh telling him his visa had been revoked and that he could be detained at any time. It warned that if he was deported, he could be sent to a country other than his own. Roy thought about leaving the U.S. but decided to stay after talking to a lawyer.

Anxious about being in his own apartment, Roy went to stay with his second cousin and her husband nearby.

“They were scared someone was going to pick me up from the street and take me somewhere that they wouldn’t even know,” Roy said.

He mostly stayed inside, turned off his phone unless he needed to use it, and avoided internet browsers that track user data through cookies. His professors were understanding when he told them he wouldn’t be able to come to classes for a while, he said.

New doubts about students’ future in the U.S.

After the judge’s order Friday, he moved back to his apartment. He learned Tuesday his status had been restored, and he plans to return to class. But he’s still nervous. He asked his two roommates, both international students, to let him know before they open the door if someone they don’t know knocks.

The judge’s restoration of his legal status is temporary. Another hearing scheduled for Thursday will determine whether he keeps that status while the litigation continues.

Roy chose the U.S. over other options in Canada and Australia because of the research opportunities and potential for professional connections, and he ultimately wanted to teach at an American university. But now those plans are up in the air.

His parents, back in Dhaka, have been watching the news and are “freaked out,” he said. His father mentioned to him that they have family in Melbourne, Australia, including a cousin who’s an assistant professor at a university there.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm8ekk173zo,Trump administration reverses termination of visas for foreign students,"Trump administration reverses termination of foreign students' visas

A campus protest against the revocation of international student visas and legal status at the City University of New York

An estimated 1,800 students and 280 universities have been impacted, according to a tally from Inside Higher Ed.

The announcement follows more than 100 lawsuits filed by students who were abruptly stripped of their legal right to study in US universities.

US Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Kurlan told a federal court that immigration officials are now working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students.

The Trump administration is restoring visas for hundreds of foreign students who had their legal status abruptly terminated stoking panic among many who feared immediate deportation, government officials have confirmed.

Many affected students appeared to have participated in political protests or have had previous criminal charges, such as driving infractions.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had previously said the administration would terminate status for people whose actions the administration believes run counter to US interests.

The policy has caused widespread fear and confusion across hundreds of US universities, with some students opting to leave the country pre-emptively rather than face possible detention or deportation.

The Justice Department told the court on Friday that records would be restored in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS), which tracks foreign students' compliance with their visas.

But Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) still maintains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons.

For example, ""if a student fails to maintain his or her nonimmigrant status after the record is reactivated, or engages in other unlawful activity that would render him or her removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act"", Kurlan told a federal court in California, NBC News reported.

Attorneys for the students have argued that the revocations violate the students' legal rights, and the fear of detention has prevented them from fulfilling their studies.

Attorneys representing students across the country said that their clients had seen their records restored in recent days, according to NBC News.

Losing their SEVIS records left students vulnerable to immigration actions - and possible detention and deportation, according to Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School.

""What I'm hearing is that this is a reprieve for many students who have had their status reinstated in SEVIS,"" Prof Mukherjee said. ""But this doesn't mean this ordeal is over for the students who have had their records terminated.""

The Justice Department and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

WASHINGTON— During President Trump’s 100 days in office, the Department of Homeland Security published a non-exhaustive list of facts, to help set the record straight on numerous false and misleading stories that have spread around news coverage and social media.

The list can be found below:

The Facts on Noteworthy Individuals Deported or Prevented from Entering the U.S.

The Deportation Of American Citizens The media has FALSELY claimed that ICE is deporting US citizen children of illegal aliens. This is false. In both cases the mother made the determination to take her children with her back to Honduras. DHS takes our responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected. The Trump Administration is giving parents in this country illegally the opportunity to self-deport and take control of their departure process with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream. The CBP Home app is a free and easy way to self deport.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia - The “Maryland Man” Garcia is NOT an American citizen. He is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living in the country illegally. In 2019, two courts – an immigration court and an appellate immigration court – ruled that he was not only a member of MS-13, but that he was in our country illegally. There was a deportation order for him dating back to 2019. Further details about Garcia’s history prove that he is far from innocent. In 2020, his wife filed a petition for protection citing three separate instances of violence In 2021, his wife filed for a restraining order against him due to domestic violence. In 2022, Garcia was pulled over by Tennessee Highway Patrol with 8 people crammed into one car. Despite telling the officers that they were going on a trip from Houston, Texas to Temple Hills, Maryland, there was no sign of luggage in the car. It was later revealed that the vehicle Garcia was driving during this stop was registered to another illegal alien who had been convicted of human trafficking, Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes. The media further claimed that the Supreme Court ordered the Trump Administration to return Garcia to the United States. This is another falsehood. The Supreme Court unanimously overturned that judge’s ruling but instead said that the United States should “facilitate” Garcia’s return. This would only be possible if the government of El Salvador decided to return him, in which case the United States would have to provide transportation. It’s up to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and the government of El Salvador if they want to return him. But as President Bukele said during his Oval Office visit with President Trump, he has no intention of releasing a terrorist and sending him back to the United States. When President Trump declared MS-13 a foreign terrorist organization, Abrego Garcia became no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in the United States. He had a valid deportation order. Furthermore, the Supreme Court also held that EVEN IF El Salvador returned this MS-13 member to the United States, we could deport him a second time. NO version of this legally ends with him ever living in the U.S., because he is a citizen of El Salvador. The foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the President – not by a court – and no court in the United States has the power to conduct the foreign policy of the United States.

Dr. Rasha Alawieh - ""The Brown University Assistant Professor"" Dr. Rasha Alawieh was an assistant professor at Brown University. She was in the United States with an H-1B visa. She was deported back to her home country of Lebanon after she admitted to attending the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, a brutal terrorist who led Hezbollah and was responsible for killing hundreds of Americans. The media tried to portray Alawieh’s case as an example of a “lawful immigrant” being deported. But they completely ignored her direct and alarming ties to radical Islamic terrorism, including her veneration of a dead terrorist leader.

Alfredo “Alex” Orellana - ""The Caregiver"" Alfredo “Alex” Orellana has multiple charges on his record from 2012 to 2019, including: distributing drugs, drug possession, assault and battery, failure to appear to court (twice), theft at the second degree, and larceny. He has since been arrested and faces deportation. The New York Times wrote a lengthy article on Orellana’s case. Their article painted a picture of a loving 31-year-old caregiver who was the “best friend” of a 28-year-old autistic man. They also pointed to the fact that Orellana had a green card. The press tried to paint him as a victim who was a caretaker, despite violent charges on his record.

Jerce Reyes Barrios - ""The Venezuelan Soccer Player"" Jerce Reyes Barrios was in the United States illegally. He was a member of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang, and he was deported to El Salvador. He has tattoos that are consistent with those indicating membership in the vicious Tren de Aragua gang. His own social media indicates that he is a Tren de Aragua member. That hasn’t stopped the media, however. They tried to whip up a frenzy over this deported criminal gang member, publishing wild claims that he was deported because of a tattoo of a soccer team on his arm. The facts are the facts. Our intelligence assessments go beyond just social media and tattoos. We are confident in our findings.

Nascimento Blair - ""The Ex-Con"" Blair was an illegal alien living in the United States who was tried and convicted for kidnapping and sentenced to 15 years in prison. The New York Times published a fawning profile about this criminal illegal alien. In 2008, he was ordered removed out of the country. However, because of the Biden administration’s open border policies, this criminal illegal alien was released onto the streets of New York. The Trump administration is putting the American people first by getting this criminal illegal alien off the streets and out of our country.

""The French Scientist Denied Entry Over His Political Views"" In March, a French scientist was denied entry into the United States. The researcher in question was in possession of confidential information on his electronic device from Los Alamos National Laboratory. This was in clear violation of a non-disclosure agreement - something he admitted to taking without permission and attempted to conceal to authorities. The mainstream media ran with the baseless narrative that this individual was blocked from entering the U.S. because of social media posts that were critical of President Trump. This lie was even echoed by France’s Minister for Higher Education, Philippe Baptiste. His political beliefs were not considered at all in his removal.

Marie Lepère and Charlotte Pohl – ""German Tourists Turned Away on Vacation"" Two German tourists were denied entry after attempting to enter the U.S. under false pretenses. Both claimed they were touring California but later admitted that they intended to work. One used a Visitor visa, while the other used the Visa Waiver Program. Under U.S. immigration laws, work is prohibited for these visas. The media version of events depicted two young women who tried to go on a five-week backpacking trip through the United States. The media claimed that the two – aged 18 and 19 – were “deported” because they simply wanted to go on a fun, loosely-planned trip. These travelers weren’t deported—they were denied entry. And the reason for their removal was visa fraud, not because of the planning nature of their so-called “vacation.”

Jose Hermosillo – ""The American Citizen Detained by Border Patrol"" Hermosillo turned himself in to immigration authorities on April 8. He approached Border Patrol in Tucson, Arizona and declared that he had entered the U.S. illegally. He completed a sworn statement identifying as a Mexican citizen who had entered unlawfully. He was processed and appeared in court on April 11. Afterwards, he was held by the U.S. Marshals in Florence, Arizona. A few days later, his family presented documents showing U.S. citizenship. The charges were dismissed, and he was released to his family. The media, instead of reporting the facts, created a false and baseless story that an American citizen was illegally detained. Hermosillio’s arrest was the direct action of his own actions and statements. When his citizenship was confirmed, he was promptly released back to his family.

Kseniia Petrova - ""The Russian Scientist Trying to Cure Cancer"" Kseniia Petrova, a Russian researcher working for Harvard University, was lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country. A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits. Messages found on her phone revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them. She knowingly broke the law and took deliberate steps to evade it. But upon her detainment, the media rushed to defend her by claiming that her research could help to cure cancer. The facts of the matter are simple: Petrova broke the law and actively planned to do so. Her research does not make her exempt from the laws of our country.

Renato Subotic – ""The MMA Coach"" Subotic is an MMA coach who entered the United States under a visa waiver program that prohibits compensation – only travel reimbursements are allowed. When Subotic was detained under American law, the media claimed that he was thrown in prison and deported for no real reason. Here are the facts: Subotic couldn’t meet the requirement to prove he wasn’t being compensated for participating at a high-dollar, multi-day event. The law is clear: the burden of proof is on the traveler. Since he couldn’t provide detailed answers or the necessary documentation for compensation related to the work event, he was held until the next available flight out the following day.

Ricardo Jesus Prada Vasquez – The ""Disappearing” Delivery Driver Yet again, the media has manufactured a fake controversy on behalf of a terrorist gang member and criminal illegal alien. Ricardo Jesus Prada Vasquez is a Venezuelan national and confirmed member of Tren De Aragua. He entered the United States illegally on November 29, 2024 at the Brownsville, Texas Port of Entry via the CBP One App. The Biden administration, like it did with so many other dangerous criminals, released Prada Vasquez back into the United States. On January 15th, Prada was encountered trying to enter the U.S. from Canada. He was detained, investigated, and confirmed as a member of TDA and a public safety threat. On February 27, a judge ordered him removed from the U.S. He was then removed to El Salvador. The media, however, has falsely claimed that Prada Vasquez was an innocent delivery driver who was “disappeared” by the government. Prada Vasquez was living and working in the U.S. illegally, he was a member of a criminal gang designated as a terrorist organization, and was deported with full compliance with American law.

Jeanette Vizguerra – ""The Activist Who Needed Sanctuary"" Jeanette Vizguerra is a convicted criminal alien from Mexico who has a final order of deportation issued by a federal immigration judge. She illegally entered the United States near El Paso, Texas, on Dec. 24, 1997, and has received legal due process in U.S. immigration court. The media, however, has tried to turn her into a martyr. They claim she was an “activist” who needed “sanctuary.” In reality, she getting famous and making money for breaking the law. Under President Trump, this is a nation of laws. We will find, arrest, and deport illegal aliens, no matter how famous the media thinks they are. Vizguerra was in the United States illegally. She was convicted of breaking the law. She was deported. If you come to our country illegally, we will deport you, and you will never return. The safest option for illegal aliens is to self-deport, so they still have the opportunity to return and live the American dream.



The Facts on Those Who Have Abused The Privilege of a Student Visa

Yunseo Chung – ""The Columbia Student"" Yunseo Chung, who was born in South Korea, is a Columbia University student who engaged in concerning conduct on-campus. This includes her being arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College.

Mahmoud Khalil - ""The Activist Leader at Columbia"" Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student from Syria, is one of the ringleaders of the vicious, anti-American, anti-Semitic protests at Columbia University. His activities are aligned with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. On March 9, 2025, in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Khalil. But upon his arrest, radical student protesters at Columbia and across the country have attempted to turn him into a martyr, waving signs and banners bearing his likeness. Taking over private buildings, inciting violence, harassing Jewish students, defacing buildings, and passing out terrorist propaganda do not constitute free speech. A judge ruled that Khalil’s deportation can move forward. He will be removed from our country.

Mohsen Mahdawi – ""The Palestinian at Columbia University"" Mahdawi is a Palestinian who has been living in the United States on a visa while he was studying at Columbia University. Like many other anti-Israel student protesters, supporters in the media tried to claim that Mahdawi was a victim of political persecution. But his rhetoric on the war in Israel proves his terrorist sympathies. In the wake of October 7, Mahdawi said he could empathize with Hamas’s attack on Israel. He appeared on “60 Minutes” justifying the massacre. He organized and led pro-Hamas protests on Columbia University’s campus, harassed Jewish students, and openly displayed his support for a terrorist organization.

Leqaa Kordia – ""The Palestinian at Columbia University"" Leqaa Kordia was another Columbia Student who actively participated in anti-American, pro-terrorist activities on campus. However, her arrest had nothing to do with her radical activities. Kordia was arrested for immigration violations due to having overstayed her F-1 student visa, which had been terminated on January 26, 2022 for lack of attendance

Dogukan Gunaydin - ""The University of Minnesota Student"" Dogukan Gunaydin, a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI. Contrary to the mainstream media’s quick speculation that he was arrested due to his involvement in student protests, his protest activity had nothing to do with his detainment.

Badar Khan Suri – ""The Georgetown Foreign Exchange Student"" Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. The media calls him a “scholar” who was innocent of any wrongdoing, even though he was married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group.

Momodou Taal – ""The Cornell University Student"" Taal was unapologetic in his pro-terrorist views. Taal, a foreign student studying at Cornell University, participated in pro-Hamas protests on campus. He has a pinned post on his X profile that talks about a so-called “Zionist genocide,” and also states “Long live the student intifada!”

WASHINGTON— During President Trump’s 100 days in office, the Department of Homeland Security published a non-exhaustive list of facts, to help set the record straight on numerous false and misleading stories that have spread around news coverage and social media.

The list can be found below:

The Facts on Noteworthy Individuals Deported or Prevented from Entering the U.S.

The Deportation Of American Citizens The media has FALSELY claimed that ICE is deporting US citizen children of illegal aliens. This is false. In both cases the mother made the determination to take her children with her back to Honduras. DHS takes our responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.

Renato Subotic – ""The MMA Coach"" Subotic is an MMA coach who entered the United States under a visa waiver program that prohibits compensation – only travel reimbursements are allowed. When Subotic was detained under American law, the media claimed that he was thrown in prison and deported for no real reason. Here are the facts: Subotic couldn’t meet the requirement to prove he wasn’t being compensated for participating at a high-dollar, multi-day event. The law is clear: the burden of proof is on the traveler. Since he couldn’t provide detailed answers or the necessary documentation for compensation related to the work event, he was held until the next available flight out the following day.

Ricardo Jesus Prada Vasquez – The ""Disappearing” Delivery Driver Yet again, the media has manufactured a fake controversy on behalf of a terrorist gang member and criminal illegal alien. Ricardo Jesus Prada Vasquez is a Venezuelan national and confirmed member of Tren De Aragua. He entered the United States illegally on November 29, 2024 at the Brownsville, Texas Port of Entry via the CBP One App. The Biden administration, like it did with so many other dangerous criminals, released Prada Vasquez back into the United States. On January 15th, Prada was encountered trying to enter the U.S. from Canada. He was detained, investigated, and confirmed as a member of TDA and a public safety threat. On February 27, a judge ordered him removed from the U.S. He was then removed to El Salvador. The media, however, has falsely claimed that Prada Vasquez was an innocent delivery driver who was “disappeared” by the government. Prada Vasquez was living and working in the U.S. illegally, he was a member of a criminal gang designated as a terrorist organization, and was deported with full compliance with American law.

Jeanette Vizguerra – ""The Activist Who Needed Sanctuary"" Jeanette Vizguerra is a convicted criminal alien from Mexico who has a final order of deportation issued by a federal immigration judge. She illegally entered the United States near El Paso, Texas, on Dec. 24, 1997, and has received legal due process in U.S. immigration court. The media, however, has tried to turn her into a martyr. They claim she was an “activist” who needed “sanctuary.” In reality, she getting famous and making money for breaking the law. Under President Trump, this is a nation of laws. We will find, arrest, and deport illegal aliens, no matter how famous the media thinks they are. Vizguerra was in the United States illegally. She was convicted of breaking the law. She was deported. If you come to our country illegally, we will deport you, and you will never return. The safest option for illegal aliens is to self-deport, so they still have the opportunity to return and live the American dream.



The Facts on Those Who Have Abused The Privilege of a Student Visa

Yunseo Chung – ""The Columbia Student"" Yunseo Chung, who was born in South Korea, is a Columbia University student who engaged in concerning conduct on-campus. This includes her being arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College.

Mahmoud Khalil - ""The Activist Leader at Columbia"" Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student from Syria, is one of the ringleaders of the vicious, anti-American, anti-Semitic protests at Columbia University. His activities are aligned with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. On March 9, 2025, in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Khalil. But upon his arrest, radical student protesters at Columbia and across the country have attempted to turn him into a martyr, waving signs and banners bearing his likeness. Taking over private buildings, inciting violence, harassing Jewish students, defacing buildings, and passing out terrorist propaganda do not constitute free speech. A judge ruled that Khalil’s deportation can move forward. He will be removed from our country.

Mohsen Mahdawi – ""The Palestinian at Columbia University"" Mahdawi is a Palestinian who has been living in the United States on a visa while he was studying at Columbia University. Like many other anti-Israel student protesters, supporters in the media tried to claim that Mahdawi was a victim of political persecution. But his rhetoric on the war in Israel proves his terrorist sympathies. In the wake of October 7, Mahdawi said he could empathize with Hamas’s attack on Israel. He appeared on “60 Minutes” justifying the massacre. He organized and led pro-Hamas protests on Columbia University’s campus, harassed Jewish students, and openly displayed his support for a terrorist organization.

Leqaa Kordia – ""The Palestinian at Columbia University"" Leqaa Kordia was another Columbia Student who actively participated in anti-American, pro-terrorist activities on campus. However, her arrest had nothing to do with her radical activities. Kordia was arrested for immigration violations due to having overstayed her F-1 student visa, which had been terminated on January 26, 2022 for lack of attendance

Dogukan Gunaydin - ""The University of Minnesota Student"" Dogukan Gunaydin, a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI. Contrary to the mainstream media’s quick speculation that he was arrested due to his involvement in student protests, his protest activity had nothing to do with his detainment.

Badar Khan Suri – ""The Georgetown Foreign Exchange Student"" Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. The media calls him a “scholar” who was innocent of any wrongdoing, even though he was married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group.

Momodou Taal – ""The Cornell University Student"" Taal was unapologetic in his pro-terrorist views. Taal, a foreign student studying at Cornell University, participated in pro-Hamas protests on campus. He has a pinned post on his X profile that talks about a so-called “Zionist genocide,” and also states “Long live the student intifada!”



Other Fake News Narratives Corrected"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/visa-cancellations-and-deportations-sow-panic-for-international-students,Visa cancellations and deportations sow panic for international students,"WASHINGTON (AP) — At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they’d discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.

In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.

“We thought it was going to be something that was unusual,” said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. “But it seems now like it’s coming pretty fast and furious.”

The speed and scope of the federal government’s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.

At least 901 students at more than 128 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.

Students apparently targeted over minor infractions

Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year — a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.

Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.

WATCH: How college communities are reacting to funding threats, international student arrests

Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.

“We don’t know, and that’s the scary part,” he said.

The students were informed of the status terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a “criminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,” Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn’t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.

Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.

But many students say they don’t fall under those categories. Students have filed lawsuits in several states, arguing they were denied due process.

In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Wisconsin issued a similar order, ruling the government could not take steps to detain or revoke the visa of a University of Wisconsin-Madison gradate student.

Two graduate students at Montana State University, Bozeman, on Tuesday were granted a temporary restraining order by a federal judge in Montana, restoring their terminated legal status and shielding them from efforts to remove them from the U.S.

In a break from past, feds cancel students’ status directly

At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.

The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.

“You don’t need more than a small number to create fear,” Aw said. “There’s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.”

Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.

The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.

Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.

Still others caught in legal limbo aren’t students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on “optional practical training,” a one-year period — or up to three for science and technology graduates — that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.

Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this “optional practical training.” About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.

Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.

“We have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,” said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.

“These are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,” he said. “They’ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren’t hiding. They’re in school.”

Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.

A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university’s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.

“That is the most scary part because you don’t know whether you’re going to be the next person,” she said.

https://www.nafsa.org/ie-magazine/students-at-risk,International Students and Scholars at Risk: What to Know Right Now,"Since mid-March, NAFSA has been collecting reports of international students and scholars who have had their visas revoked, their records terminated in SEVIS, and/or who have been arrested or detained. Based on our initial analysis of these reports, extensive conversations with our members, and consultation with immigration attorneys, NAFSA is able to provide some preliminary information about the size, scale, and nature of the enforcement actions affecting international students and scholars in the United States.

Below are eight important things to understand about the current situation—and two actions you can take.

As of April 21, there have been more than 1,400 reports of international students and scholars either having their visa revoked and/or their record in SEVIS terminated, thereby jeopardizing their legal status in the United States. Undergraduate, graduate, and Optional Practical Training (OPT)/STEM OPT students are affected. There is no clear pattern or trend in the nationalities of the affected students. Students from all regions of the world are being affected. The visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations are happening to students at all types of higher education institutions, from community colleges to R-1 research institutions, and in all regions of the United States. The cause given for the SEVIS record termination has changed. When NAFSA first became aware of these terminations, the rationale given was tied to sections of the Immigration and Naturalization Act and references to being a foreign policy threat. Now the reason given is “other“ with a vague reference to a criminal records check “and/or“ a visa revocation. There is still no transparency on the grounds for these revocations, nor is there any clear process for determining what the charges are against the students. Due process is woefully absent. Students are rightfully terrified and in need of support—and in many cases legal advice. Colleges and universities have an important role to play in attending to the mental health of their students as well as their academic success. We’re aware of institutions providing drop-in hours for Q&A sessions with mental health professionals and offices of student support; offering referrals to immigration attorneys; and even providing financial assistance to cover legal consultation fees. International offices, the institution’s general counsel, communications offices, human resources, student affairs, offices of the registrar and others should all be in close communication as the facts on the ground shift daily.

NAFSA is dedicated to supporting members as they work tirelessly to support international student and scholars. Here’s what you can do:"

https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/ACE-Assns-Demand-Answers-Visa-Revocations.aspx,"ACE, Higher Ed Associations Demand Answers as Student Visa Revocations Spread Nationwide","Section 1 Content

​ACE and 15 other higher education associations have requested an urgent briefing from the departments of State and Homeland Security (DHS), following widespread reports that international students are being stripped of their visas and ordered to leave the country with little or no warning.In an April 4 letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the associations cited growing concern over visa cancellations that appear to be tied to social media activity, political expression, or minor infractions.



“We seek clarity amidst reports that student visas are being revoked and records are being terminated in the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) without additional information being shared with the institutions those students attend,” wrote ACE President Ted Mitchell on behalf of the groups. Affected students are being left in legal limbo with institutions scrambling to respond.



""We support the need for the federal government to safeguard national security, including vetting visas and overseeing the process for deciding who should be allowed to enter and remain in the country and under what terms,"" the letter continued. ""Recent actions have contributed to uncertainty and impedes the ability of our institutions to best advise international students and scholars. It is important institutions are in a position to reassure international students so they can continue to make exceptional contributions to their campuses, communities, and the nation.""

The visa revocations have been gaining national attention for weeks, with campuses, legal experts, and advocacy groups raising alarm. The New York Times highlighted the higher education community’s concerns and noted that ACE’s letter calls for greater transparency and communication from federal agencies.



Over the past several weeks, more than 300 student and visitor visas have been revoked, according to Secretary Rubio. In some cases, the revocations appear to be tied to students’ participation in campus protests or social media activity, while in others, visa status was canceled based on past infractions as minor as traffic violations. These actions are likely related to the Jan. 20 executive order, “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.”



The scope of the actions is sweeping and still unfolding. In California alone, at least six University of California campuses have reported student visa terminations, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that cases also have emerged at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), University of Oregon, University of Kentucky, Arizona State University, University of Colorado, and others.



In many cases, students learned their visas were revoked only after receiving abrupt emails or text messages ordering them to self-deport—sometimes after being detained. One student enrolled at the University of California San Diego was reportedly detained at the border, denied entry to the country, and deported without warning. And in many cases, universities only learned of the visa terminations by checking SEVIS.



Legal experts note that international students have constitutional protections, including First Amendment rights—but visa status can still be revoked unilaterally. Appeals are rare and seldom successful, according to The New York Times. But the policy shift marks a sharp break from past practice, where students whose visas were canceled could typically remain in the U.S. to finish their studies. Under the Trump administration, both visa and SEVIS status are being terminated, forcing immediate departure.



At UMass Amherst, Chancellor Javier Reyes said the revocations took place “under unclear circumstances“ and announced the university has established an Angel Fund to assist students with legal and living expenses.



In their letter, the higher education associations emphasized that international students contribute $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy annually and support more than 375,000 American jobs. They play a vital role in advancing global scholarship and strengthening U.S. diplomacy.



ACE and its partners will continue to push for a meeting with State and DHS officials to clarify the administration’s approach, understand how terms like “support for terrorism” are being defined, and explore ways to protect national security without undermining U.S. higher education."

WASHINGTON — The federal government is expanding the reasons international students can be stripped of their legal status in the U.S., where thousands have come under scrutiny in a Trump administration crackdown that has left many afraid of being deported.

Attorneys for international students say the new reasons allow for quicker deportations and serve to justify many of the actions the government took this spring to cancel foreign students' permission to study in the U.S.

After abruptly losing their legal status in recent weeks with little explanation, students around the country filed challenges in federal courts. In many cases, judges made preliminary rulings that the government acted without due process.

Then the government said it would issue new guidelines for canceling a student's legal status. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement document shared Monday in a court filing said valid reasons now include the revocation of the visas students used to enter the U.S.

In the past, if a student's visa was revoked, they generally could stay in the U.S. to finish school. They simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.

“This just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students, even if they’ve done nothing wrong,” said Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student who lost his status in the crackdown. The student was once charged with a traffic offense, which appeared in a law enforcement database searched by immigration authorities.

Banias said the new guidelines vastly expand the authority of ICE beyond its previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds to take away a student's permission to be in the country.

Students learn their records were removed

In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records were removed from a student database maintained by ICE. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.

As the court challenges mounted, federal officials said Friday that the government would restore international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future action. The new policy emerged in court a few days later.

The new guidance allows for revoking students' status if their names appear in a criminal or fingerprint database in a way that was not permitted in the past, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who has filed a lawsuit on behalf of 133 people in the U.S. on student visas who lost their legal status.

“Basically, they’re trying to cover what they already did bad by making the bad thing that they did now legal for them to do,” Kuck said.

Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their records, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.

Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was revoked and then reinstated this month, and he asked the court to keep him from being deported.

In court filings and at the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.

In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said Tuesday at the hearing. One of the students was Patel, who was pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped — information that is also in the database.

Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: “Please terminate all in SEVIS,” referring to a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.

Judge suggests government did not review individual records

Reyes said the short time frame suggested no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names were in the database.

“All of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,” said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated “an utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.”

While the Department of Homeland Security was revoking students’ legal status, the State Department was canceling the visas some students used to enter the country.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he canceled some visas because of student involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, which he says hurt U.S. foreign policy interests. But he acknowledged in March that some of the cancellations were “unrelated to any protests"" and were ""just having to do with potential criminal activity.”

“My standard: If we knew this information about them before we gave them a visa, would we have allowed them in?” Rubio told reporters in March. “If the answer is no, then we revoke the visa.”

Even though students used to remain in the U.S. after their visas were revoked, Rubio espoused a different standard in March: “Your visa is expired, your visa is revoked, you have to leave,” he said. “There is no right to a student visa.”

Crackdown sowed chaos and confusion on campus

At the start of the crackdown, when colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.

In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.

Government attorneys said the change in the foreign students database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled “failure to maintain status.” Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an “investigative red flag.”

Patel ""is lawfully present in the U.S.,” Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. “He is not subject to immediate detention or removal.”

Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.

https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-releases-2022-sevp-annual-report,Archived: ICE releases 2022 SEVP annual report,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released its calendar year 2022 Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) annual report on April 26, detailing the international student population. This report highlights calendar year 2022 data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a web-based system that includes information about international students, exchange visitors, and dependents while they are in the United States.

The total number of SEVIS records for active F-1 and M-1 students was 1,362,157 in calendar year 2022, an increase of 10.1 percent from calendar year 2021. While this increase is significant, these figures remain below pre-pandemic numbers, which were 1,523,758 in calendar year 2019.

All four regions in the United States saw an increase in international student records from 2021 to 2022. California continued to host more international students than any other state.

All continents saw an overall increase in the number of students coming to the United States last year. International F-1 and M-1 students came from every continent in the world other than Antarctica, and from more than 227 countries and territories. The number of international student records from China and India made Asia the most popular continent of origin. However, China sent fewer students in 2022 in comparison to 2021, while India sent more students.

The full SEVIS by the numbers report can be viewed online, and additional SEVIS data can also be viewed in the SEVP Data Library.

ICE reviews SEVIS records for potential violations and refers cases with possible national security concerns to its field offices for further investigation. Additionally, SEVP’s Analysis and Operations Center analyzes student and school records for administrative compliance with federal regulations related to studying in the United States.
