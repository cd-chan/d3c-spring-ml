https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/international-students-revoked-visas-reasons-why-rcna200313,Why the Trump administration is revoking international student visas,"Kimmy Yam, Kimmy Yam Is A Reporter For Nbc Asian America.",2025-04-16 18:24:00+00:00,"“It’s just part of their whole plan about reducing immigration entirely,” said Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney who runs a virtual law firm and represents several international students, most of them Asian. “They come after the small and the weak — people who don’t have as many resources to defend themselves.”

Students and schools say there is mass confusion about the reasons behind the revocations, the legality of the government’s actions and what options those without visas or status now have when it comes to getting their education.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Which student visas are at risk, and what do they do?

Most of the students who have been targeted are studying in the United States under the F-1 and J-1 visas. The F-1 visa allows noncitizens to enter the United States as full-time students at accredited education institutions. And to qualify for those visas, people must meet certain criteria, including approval from ICE, proficiency in English or enrollment in courses that lead to English proficiency and sufficient funds to support themselves during their entire courses of study.

The J-1 visa, available to students, teachers, researchers and other specialists, allows people to participate in approved programs for studying, conducting research, receiving training or demonstrating special skills. And after their programs are complete, they are required to return to their countries within 30 days.

Which schools are being affected?

The State Department began revoking visas last month, targeting foreign-born students at schools across the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that the State Department has revoked hundreds of students’ visas, taking aim at international students who participate in political activism.

“It might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” Rubio said at a news conference last month.

Those students have included Mahmoud Khalil, of Columbia University, a pro-Palestinian activist and green-card holder, whom ICE arrested and detained in early March, and Rümeysa Öztürk, of Tufts University, whom immigration officials apprehended on the street near the school a few weeks later.

Other cases fall outside the bounds of political protest, like that of Doğukan Günaydın, a Turkish student at the University of Minnesota, who was arrested in front of his home in St. Paul at the end of March because of a 2023 drunken driving conviction.

Shao said he has encountered many other cases of students in fields from materials engineering to epilepsy research. Some students were given vague reasons for the visa revocations, while others weren’t given any at all. Many schools said they were in the dark, as well.

Stanford, for example, said it found out about six visa revocations while it was doing a routine check of its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System database, which maintains information about nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors.

“It really feels like somebody wrote a computer program: ‘If arrested, then terminate,’” Shao said.

The State Department directed NBC News to comments spokesperson Tammy Bruce made Tuesday at a media briefing.

“We don’t discuss individual visas because of the privacy issues involved,” Bruce said. “What we can tell you is that the department revokes visas every day in order to secure our borders and to keep our community safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security recently created a task force that uses data analytic tools to scour international students’ social media histories for potential grounds to revoke their visas, three sources familiar with the operation previously told NBC News. They also said that the task force is searching for charges and criminal convictions on students’ records as well.

Why is the Trump administration targeting students?

The Trump administration hasn’t said publicly why such students are being singled out over others. But immigration attorneys and policy experts say it all goes back to the centerpiece of the Trump campaign: mass deportations. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said it is an example of the administration’s taking a “whole-of-government” approach to that immigration strategy.

“Here we’re seeing the Department of State working to cancel the visas of many students and those actions being done in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, which is the agency in charge of prosecuting these deportation cases in court,” Bush-Joseph said.

In the cases of Öztürk and other students who have been arrested in recent weeks, the Trump administration has cited a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens if the secretary determines their presence in the country would result in “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, said it’s also an effort by the government to send a “clear message about who is unwelcome in the United States,” especially since most students appear to be from nonwhite backgrounds.

“U.S. immigration policy seems to be driven by xenophobia, white nationalism and racism right now,” Mukherjee said.

What legal rights do students have?

Multiple students have sued the government because of the revocations.

The government maintains the right to revoke visas for various reasons, including DUI convictions or related offenses. They can also be revoked for national security purposes at the discretion of the State Department.

“Given the fact that the executive branch has such far-reaching discretion in many cases, it can be really difficult to determine what’s going on in specific cases,” Bush-Joseph said. “As a quick example of this, for a green card, someone can meet all of the requirements and still be denied just as a matter of discretion.”

Typically, Shao said, students are unable to appeal visa revocations. However, they can still reapply for visas. And they still have other rights, including the ability to stay in the country, as long as they don’t leave and try to re-enter.

However, many of the international students’ legal statuses were terminated, as well, making them potentially subject to detention and deportation, Shao said. But the government typically doesn’t have the right to remove legal status without actions such as crimes of violence or unauthorized work or dropping out of school.

“Getting your visa terminated is not automatically a reason to reject your status,” Shao said.

Still, many provisions of the Constitution protect all people, regardless of their status. And that means the students still have the right to defend themselves under due process and can’t be deported without it, Mukherjee said. The Supreme Court affirmed that Monday in its ruling on the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, she said. The court ruled that people have the right to challenge the use of the act and should be given time to challenge their detentions before they are taken out of the country.

“These are some basic principles of law, basic principles underlying the Constitution, and should be respected by all three branches of government,” she said. “We are at the brink of a breakdown in the rule of law and the immigration space.”

Often, other forms of immigration relief are available to international students, including humanitarian relief.

And while some students have received messages from the State Department urging them to self-deport, Mukherjee said they don’t necessarily have to listen. Instead, she advises them to seek legal support.

“Simply because the notice says you have to depart the United States immediately or you need to depart from the United States within five days, that doesn’t make it lawful or true or correct or accurate,” Mukherjee said.

Shao also said schools should step in to provide support.

“You accepted these kids to come,” Shao said. “The school should try to help the kids as much as they can.”","The State Department began revoking visas last month, targeting foreign-born students at schools across the country.

Protesters march as they rally for Gaza and demand the release of detained Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, March 18, 2025, in New York City.

President Donald Trump's administration has set off a legal and ethical firestorm by targeting international students at United States colleges for deportation, including some who the government alleges participated in protests or activities on campuses in support of Palestine.

The administration has claimed, without presenting evidence, that some of those students supported the terrorist organization Hamas, while the students say the White House is treading on their constitutional right to free speech and the longstanding tradition of participating in campus demonstrations.

Since Trump's Jan. 30 executive order to ""combat the explosion of anti-Semitism on our campuses and streets"" in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the State Department has revoked around 300 visas so far, many of them held by college students alleged to have participated in activities advocating for Palestine and its people on the nation's campuses, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

""If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us the reason you are coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus – we're not going to give you a visa,"" Rubio said, adding, ""Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.""

Here's what we know and don't know about some of the more high-profile cases involving foreign students who have had their visas revoked, who have been detained or who have self-deported after being targeted by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Mahmoud Khalil

Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old Columbia University international affairs graduate student of Palestinian descent, was arrested on March 8 when ICE agents appeared at his student apartment building, despite him being a legal permanent U.S. resident in possession of a green card. Khalil is married to an American citizen, who is pregnant with their first child.

The Trump administration accused Khalil, a Palestinian activist, of supporting Hamas and distributing ""pro-Hamas propaganda,"" though it has provided no evidence to support that claim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed on March 11 that Khalil distributed ""pro-Hamas propaganda fliers with the logo of Hamas,"" but declined to provide details.

Ramzi Kassem, the director of CLEAR, a group representing Khalil, called Leavitt's claim ""nonsense"" and said there is ""no truth to it whatsoever.""

During a pro-Palestinian student protest at Columbia University last spring, Khalil served as a negotiator when students bargained with school officials over a tent encampment they established on campus. During the days-long demonstration, some protestors also occupied the school's Hamilton Hall and defied orders to disperse, prompting the university to write a letter formally allowing the New York Police Department to enter the campus and break up the protest, during which time they made dozens of arrests. Khalil was not among those arrested, according to the NYPD, who confirmed to ABC News that ""there are no arrests on file"" for Khalil.

""His one and only goal was to get Columbia University to divest from its complicity with Israeli government crimes in Gaza and the West Bank,"" Kassem said of Khalil's involvement in the protests.

Khalil is being held at an ICE detention facility in Louisiana and has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government's attempt to deport him. He has not been charged with a crime, although the government alleges he intentionally misrepresented information on his green card application and therefore is inadmissible to the United States.

According to recent court filings, the Trump administration said Khalil failed to disclose when applying for his green card last year that his employment by the Syria Office at the British Embassy in Beirut went ""beyond 2022"" and that he was a ""political affairs officer"" for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNWRA) from June to November 2023.

In arresting Khalil, the government invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that they said allows the secretary of state to revoke the legal status of people whose presence in the country could have ""adverse foreign policy consequences.""

In a letter he released from the detention facility in which he's being held, Khalil described himself as a ""political prisoner.""

""My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night,"" Khalil wrote in the March 18 letter, referring to the renewed attacks on Gaza after the collapse of the ceasefire.

A federal judge in New Jersey on April 2 retained Khalil's case, rejecting the government’s request to move it to Louisiana or dismiss it altogether. The opinion, unless appealed by the government, would clear the way for the judge to decide the more substantive issues of Khalil's continued confinement.

Khalil is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge for a removal hearing on April 8.

Ranjani Srinivasan

An urban planning doctoral student at Columbia University, Ranjani Srinivasan, a citizen of India who was in the country on an F-1 student visa, used the U.S. Customs and Border Protection home app to self-deport on March 11, according to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem.

""Srinivasan was involved in activities supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization,"" Noem said in a March 14 statement, which did not include evidence to support the allegation against Srinivasan.

""I am not a terrorist sympathizer so I just kind of find it absurd,"" Srinivasan said during a CBC interview March 19. ""I'm a Ph.D. student … who actually rarely left the office because I was busy working or grading my students' papers.""

In a March 22 statement, the group Student Workers of Columbia – of which Srinivasan is a member, the union confirmed in response to an ABC News request for comment – said Srinivasan was notified on March 6 that her student visa had been revoked and that on March 8, ICE agents went to her Columbia housing apartment seeking entry, allegedly without a warrant, but did not arrest or detain anyone. Srinivasan was subsequently informed by the university's International Students and Scholars Office that she was being disenrolled by the university and ordered to vacate her student housing, according to the Student Workers of Columbia statement.

""With no housing or visa and a continued stream of threats from ICE to detain her, Ranjani made the difficult decision to leave the country for Canada,"" according to the statement.

Srinivasan has not been charged with a crime. The Student Workers of Columbia has been circulating a petition asking Columbia to re-enroll Srinivasan and for the government to reinstate her visa.

Leqaa Kordia

A Palestinian from the West Bank, Leqaa Kordia was arrested on March 13 by the Department of Homeland Security.

According to DHS, Kordia was arrested for allegedly overstaying her expired visa, which the agency said terminated on Jan. 26, 2022.

In a March 14 statement, DHS said that Kordia's student visa was terminated for lack of class attendance. She was previously arrested in April 2024 for her alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, according to the DHS statement.

“Columbia has no record of this individual being registered as a current or former student at the University,"" a spokesperson for the university said in response to an ABC News request for comment.

""It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,"" DHS Secretary Noem said in a statement following Kordia's arrest.

Multiple attempts to determine the current status of Kordia's case and whether she is currently being detained, including repeated ABC News inquiries to ICE and DHS, were not immediately successful.

Yunseo Chung

Yunseo Chung, a junior at Columbia University, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after ICE agents went to her residence on March 13 looking for her, one day after an ICE official signed an administrative arrest warrant for her, according to her lawsuit.

According to her lawsuit, Chung was born in South Korea but is a lawful permanent U.S. resident who has lived in the United States since she was 7 years old.

""This action challenges the government's shocking overreach in seeking to deport a college student, Plaintiff-Petitioner Yunseo Chung, who is a lawful permanent resident of this country, because of her protected free speech,"" according to Chung's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ""The government's actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny.""

The lawsuit contends, ""Simply put, immigration enforcement – here, immigration detention and threatened deportation – may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration.""

According to her lawsuit, Chung has participated since 2023 in student protests on the Columbia campus related to Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip. On March 5, Chung was among a group of students arrested by the New York Police Department for holding a sit-in at an academic building at Barnard College, according to her lawsuit. She was given a desk appearance ticket accusing her of obstruction of governmental administration, her lawsuit claims.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a March 25 statement that Chung had engaged in ""concerning conduct"" and cited her prior arrest during a protest at Barnard College, which DHS described as a ""pro-Hamas"" protest.

""ICE HSI will investigate individuals engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization,"" the DHS statement said.

""Ms. Chung has felt moved to join efforts to advocate for Palestinian human rights,"" the lawsuit states, under a heading titled Ms. Chung’s Exercise of Free Speech Rights in Support of Palestinians.

""Ms. Chung has also felt compelled to criticize Columbia for its handling of student protests supporting Palestinian human rights, including the punitive measures imposed on certain students,"" according to the lawsuit.

Chung's lawsuit also states that some opponents of pro-Palestinian protest activities ""frequently mischaracterize"" them as ""inherently supportive of Hamas or terrorism and anti-Semitic.""

A federal judge in New York issued a temporary restraining order on March 25 blocking federal agents from detaining Chung.

Rumeysa Ozturk

A Ph.D. student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national with a valid F-1 visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 near her home in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts.

In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson said: ""Rumeysa Ozturk is a Turkish national and Tufts University graduate student, granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa. DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans."" The DHS statement did not specify the activities in which Ozturk is alleged to have participated.

""A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated,"" the DHS statement further said.

On March 26, 2024, Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar, was one of four Tufts students who wrote an op-ed published in the school student newspaper, The Tufts Daily, asking the university to agree to resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Senate to divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.

""Credible accusations against Israel include accounts of deliberate starvation and indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinian civilians and plausible genocide,"" the op-ed said, in part. It's unknown whether the editorial played a part in Ozturk's arrest.

""Rumeysa has not been accused of committing any crime. It appears the only thing she is being targeted for is her right to free speech,"" Mahsa Khanbabai, an attorney representing Ozturk, said in a statement provided to ABC News.

A statement in support of Ozturk, dated April 1 and signed by Tufts President Sunil Kumar, acknowledges the March 26 editorial, and further states that the university ""has no information to support the allegations that [Ozturk] was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention,"" and that it ""has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.""

Ozturk is currently listed in the ICE database as ""in custody"" and appears to be held at an ICE processing center in Basile, Louisiana.

On March 25, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Ozturk cannot be deported until the judge determines whether the court has jurisdiction to decide whether Ozturk was lawfully taken into custody.

Judge Denise Casper said in her ruling that Ozturk ""shall not be removed from the United States until further Order by this Court.""

Following an April 3 hearing, Judge Casper did not issue a ruling and said she will first decide whether she has jurisdiction before other motions in the lawsuit can be considered.

Alireza Doroudi

Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian citizen and a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, was arrested at his home on March 25.

The Department of Homeland Security said Doroudi’s student visa was revoked and he was subsequently arrested because he ""posed significant national security concerns.""

But Doroudi's attorney, David Rozas, told ABC News that he has ""not been informed of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.""

Rozas said Doroudi has ""not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests.""

Alireza Doroudi is shown in this undated photo. LinkedIn

Doroudi was initially held in a county jail in Alabama but has since been transferred to ICE's Jena-LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana, according to the ICE website.

""He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering,"" Rozas said. ""He is also in the early stages of applying for an EB-1/Adjustment of Status as a researcher with extraordinary ability.""

Rozas said Doroudi is studying at the University of Alabama on active I-20/SEVIS status, referring to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.

Momodou Taal

A Ph.D. student of Africana studies at Cornell University, Momodou Taal filed a federal lawsuit on March 15 seeking to block the enforcement of Trump executive orders that he feared could lead to his deportation.

But six days after filing the lawsuit, the 31-year-old citizen of the U.K. and Gambia was asked to voluntarily surrender to ICE agents, according to his attorneys.

In its court filing, the Department of Justice said Taal's student visa was revoked before he filed his lawsuit but ICE agents had trouble locating him. The revocation is based on Taal's alleged involvement in “disruptive protests,” disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, the government said.

According to court records, Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell for a second time last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has limited access to the upstate New York campus as he continues his studies remotely, according to his attorneys.

""If the First Amendment does not protect the right to attend a demonstration, what's left? Not much,"" said Taal's attorney, Eric Lee.

On March 27, a federal judge denied Taal's bid to prevent his deportation and his challenge of two Trump executive orders that have been used to target other pro-Palestinian students.

Taal announced on Monday that he has exited the United States and is ""safe"" in an undisclosed country.

""Today I took the decision to leave the United States, free and with my head held high,"" Taal said in a social media post.

While his lawyers planned to make another legal argument for a temporary restraining order, Taal wrote in his post: ""Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favorable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs.""

""I have lost faith I could walk the streets without being abducted. Weighing up these options, I took the decision to leave on my own terms,"" Taal's post continued. ""This is of course not the outcome I had wanted going into this, but we are facing a government that has no respect for the judiciary or for the rule of law.""

Badar Khan Suri

A visiting scholar from India and a researcher at Georgetown University, Badar Khan Suri was detained on March 17 outside his Washington, D.C.- area apartment.

The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Suri was ""actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media."" The department also alleged he had close connections to a ""known or suspected terrorist"" who is a senior adviser to Hamas.

Suri, who is married to Mapheze Saleh, a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent, was sent to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, according to his attorney.

Badar Khan Suri Georgetown University

A lawsuit filed by Suri's attorneys said the Trump administration appeared to be targeting the Georgetown University fellow due to his wife's identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.

""This was done pursuant to a policy to retaliate against and punish noncitizens like Mr. Suri solely for their family ties to those who may have either expressed criticism of U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Israel,"" attorneys representing Suri said in a complaint.

In a sworn declaration filed March 20 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Mapheze Saleh said that following the Oct. 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, she ""shared posts on a daily basis"" about subsequent events in Gaza, ""including posts that expressed sorrow for the deaths of Gazan people."" Because of this, Saleh said, and because her father previously served in the government of Gaza until 2010, ""multiple articles were published about me and my family, and eventually about my husband. A website claimed falsely that my husband and I have 'ties to Hamas.'""

Nermeen Arastu, one of Suri's attorneys, told ABC News that Suri's detainment happened because ""President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.""

Suri has not been accused of a crime, his lawyers said.

Georgetown University said Suri was granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He Has Completed His Post Graduation In Communication, Journalism, Has Been Covering International Education For The Past Two Years. He Loves Travelling To Different Cities, Spending Time With His Dog, Is Keenly Interested In Understanding Global Politics.",2025-04-24 09:43:24+00:00,"The feature, launched at ApplyBoard’s Top Recruiters Workshop 2025 in Delhi last week, aims to enable recruitment partners to submit student applications more quickly and reliably.

“Once you choose your program and you submit your initial application, in a traditional world, you would have needed to give your documents in and wait for schools, maybe multiple back and forths and weeks to get that feedback and eventually get that offer,” Massi Basiri, co-founder and president of ApplyBoard told The PIE News.

“In our world, where we’ve rolled out Instant Submission, the moment you upload the corresponding document, you instantly get feedback. This feedback can range from the quality of the document to what’s missing, all the way to whether the document meets what the school is looking for.”

With tools like 360 Solutions, which go beyond just the application process, and ApplyProof, a document verification service, ApplyBoard has been developing its approach to how international student enrollments are handled.

More recently, the platform introduced Capio, which is designed as an “end-to-end” system aimed at helping universities manage international student enrollment more efficiently.

According to Sina Meraji, senior director of product development, ApplyBoard, the launch of Instant Submission is built on new technology shaped by years of collaboration with partners and the development of various related products.

“A big portion of the technology is basically the LLM models and machine learning models that we have. And those are the latest – we literally compared the performance of the latest models from different partners we work with and based on the performance have accelerated our updates,” stated Meraji.

The feature is particularly relevant in a market like India – one of ApplyBoard’s largest – where the number of students going abroad has surged significantly over the past decade.

“The level of service expectation once it comes to speed I have never seen in any other market,” stated Basiri.

“So I think it’s bang on for India because they do things with the speed of light and expect things with the speed of light. I don’t think it would have been any better received in any other market than India.”

The reality is that in digital worlds, you can catch fraud or inconsistencies a lot easier

Massi Basiri, ApplyBoard

While the platform helps ApplyBoard’s recruitment partners submit student applications and receive feedback seamlessly, fraudulent applications could pose a significant concern for institutions.

“Fraud becomes a critical point of view from schools because, often, it’s perceived that in a digital world, it’s easier to tamper. But the reality is that in digital worlds, you can catch fraud or inconsistencies a lot easier. Things are sometimes not even detectable with the human eye,” said Basiri.

“There are certain documents that are verifiable, like English scores. In those cases, we check against the source to ensure that the document is authentic. What’s presented on the document is matched against the back-end system of those providers.”

According to Basiri, not all documents come with that capability, so they look into other platforms, like Digilocker in India, to verify documents.

“In the absence of any other source, we use other models, AIs, and tools to look for irregularities and inconsistencies,” he added.

With ApplyBoard’s “Instant Offer” assuring offers to students once they receive feedback on their applications from institutions, Basiri addressed how the organisation can assist students if they don’t hear back from their chosen institution.

“We have multiple sets of schools, those open-minded schools that are more futuristic. They know how technology can accelerate. We work with those close partners and integrate at a greater lens systematically so we can issue those offers on their behalf,” stated Basiri.

“Apart from that, in our system now, we have other AI technology that would actually enable and help the student with things that are not common or things that they’re not familiar with. For example, we have an SOP guide we just launched, which they can use to make it easier for them to understand and create a draft.”

According to Hamed Karimian, senior product manager, ApplyBoard, the platform is looking to improve students’ chances of success by helping filter schools based on their likelihood of acceptance, while also making adjustments to the quality of documents and other application materials.

“First, we filter and sift through the schools where the student has the highest chance and then we help them to write a better SOP, make adjustments to their resume, and make sure that all the documents provided by them are in good quality, giving them a strong chance,” shared Karimian.

“Once we do all of these adjustments with the student, and help submit the application to the school, we have a 95.7% success rate for getting an admission from the schools.”","The feature, launched at ApplyBoard’s Top Recruiters Workshop 2025 in Delhi last week, aims to enable recruitment partners to submit student applications more quickly and reliably.

Our goal was to understand the scope of the federal government’s involvement in the visa process and what it means for international students and the colleges and universities they attend.

Over the past two weeks, more than 1,500 students—representing several hundred colleges and universities, as well as state systems—have had a sudden or unexpected change in their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) listing, or their F-1 or J-1 visa status.

The data we’ve gathered provides a snapshot of how the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security are acting on President Trump’s campaign promise to remove international students who engage in political activism or disrupt campus operations. But it also reveals some details about the students themselves.

Here’s what we know so far.

Our data set is growing, but still lacking.

When the map launched April 7, we identified 147 students, but that number quickly surpassed the figure Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited in a March 27 statement claiming that he had revoked 300 students’ visas. Various legal groups have suggested that the total is in the several thousands, so we expect our database to continue to grow.

From our own reporting—and the barrage of tips we received in our inboxes and over social media—we know that there are many more colleges and universities that have not disclosed information on the status of their international students. Most of them are small, private liberal arts colleges with large international student populations.

Why a college would choose not to disclose data is not entirely clear. Some say they’re protecting student identities; many are probably worried about the impact on future international student enrollment, which generates substantial tuition revenue for many institutions across the country.

At present, the database is mostly comprised of public regional or flagship colleges and universities. About 28 percent of the nearly 250 colleges are private. Additionally, the international student populations at the institutions vary, and the number of students affected doesn’t always align.

The University of Michigan, for example, has more than 8,000 foreign students but only reported 22 revocations. Meanwhile, Pima Community College in Arizona has fewer than 200 and reported one revocation. But then there’s Northwest Missouri State University, which had 716 international students as of October 2024 and reported 43 revocations.

As we scrape through individual student data in our set, about one-quarter of the 530 students analyzed so far have been identified as alumni, 8 percent as graduate students and 2 percent as undergraduates.

We don’t know much about the students themselves.

Student data is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, so any data we have gathered comes from one of a few sources: the student themselves, someone at the college or university with access to SEVIS, or a legal filing or lawyer representing the student in a lawsuit. No public database exists that provides international student visa data.

A few sources have disclosed more than just the number of students impacted; sometimes they share whether a student is currently enrolled or participating in Optional Practical Training—a program that allows F-1 visa holders to gain work experience related to their field of study—or OPT for STEM. Rarely do sources disclose the student’s nation of origin.

Of the 515 students whose data we’ve reviewed for nationality information, 450 do not have their nationality available. Of the 65 we have identified, 19 are from China, 15 are from India, five are from Kuwait, four are from Saudi Arabia, three are from Japan and two are from Turkey. The rest are a range of other nationalities.

One caveat: The higher numbers of Indian and Chinese students likely reflect their position as the top two countries of origin for foreign students enrolled at U.S. institutions. During the 2023–24 academic year, 331,602 Indian students and 277,398 Chinese students enrolled in postsecondary education in the U.S. By comparison, Canada sends roughly 28,000 students across the border each academic year.

This clearly isn’t just about antisemitism.

Initially, the State Department said it was targeting students who sought entrance to the U.S. “not just to study but to participate in movements that vandalize universities, harass students, take over buildings, and cause chaos.”

Some of the students impacted by visa revocations have been prominent social activists, including Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia University, who participated in pro-Palestinian protests and an encampment in spring 2024.

Columbia is among the colleges on our list—along with Emerson College, George Washington University, New York University, Northwestern University, the New School, Tufts University, the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of California, Berkeley—that saw large-scale campus protests and encampments this past spring.

Other campuses, however, saw little to no political engagement over the Israel-Hamas war. Webster University in St. Louis, for instance, had no noted examples of alleged antisemitism, yet 18 students had their visas revoked.

College officials say that several of the students affected weren’t involved in campus protests or considered student activists.

Officials often cite criminal activity as the rationale for revoking student visas.

International students may lose their legal standing in the U.S. for failing to meet the terms of their F-1 visa, which include being enrolled as a full-time student, not working off campus during their first year, having enough money to support themselves and maintaining a residence abroad.

But a student’s visa can also be revoked for more serious reasons, such as criminal activity, national security concerns, misrepresentation or fraud.

Some colleges and universities have said their students had visas revoked for past or minor crimes, including traffic violations, underage drinking and trespassing. Many of these cases were dismissed.

A growing number of students are suing the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security for revoking their visas. According to one lawsuit, the reason cited for students’ visa revocations was listed as “OTHER—Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated.”

Courts will likely have the final say on revocations.

So far, Inside Higher Ed has identified 28 lawsuits representing 178 students who are asking federal courts to restore their status in SEVIS and/or their visas. Several students have secured temporary restraining orders that allow them to stay in the country while the litigation continues, and at least one student had their visa reinstated.

The federal government has argued in court filings that the lawsuits should be dismissed because terminating a student’s SEVIS record doesn’t mean their visa is revoked or constitute a final action. SEVIS, a government attorney wrote, is simply a database and does not “control or even necessarily reflect whether a student has lawful nonimmigrant status.”

But some students aren’t waiting for the courts to weigh in. At least five have left the country voluntarily, according to news reports. And others never got the chance to file suit before the federal government took action. Fewer than 10 students have been arrested, detained or deported.
