Nearly a dozen students and faculty members at colleges across the country are known to have been detained by federal agents amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, which on college campuses, has taken aim at pro-Palestinian student activists and Israel critics.

Many of those detained have been granted the right to live in the US either as permanent residents or through temporary work or student visas. Their rights, however, have been put into question under new, sweeping immigration orders that some legal experts fear may be used liberally to clamp down on dissent.

Speaking to reporters last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said under his direction, more than 300 visas –– “primarily student visas, some visitor visas” –– have been revoked. Rubio did not specify how many visas belonged to people tied to the pro-Palestinian movement.

“If they’re taking activities that are counter to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we’ll revoke the visa,” Rubio said.

When asked about freedom of speech concerns, Rubio said international students are “here to study.”

“They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it’s lunacy to continue to allow that.”

Here is what we know about the detainment of college activists, students and scholars.

Mahmoud Khalil

Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs and one of the school’s most prominent pro-Palestinian activists, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

He was arrested by federal agents March 8 and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration.

The administration ordered Khalil to be deported after baselessly claiming he is a Hamas sympathizer, a threat to national security, and poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Officials later said Khalil’s deportation was justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident –– an argument his attorneys call weak.

On March 19, a judge blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred his case to New Jersey.

While Department of Justice officials have sought to keep Khalil’s case in Louisiana since his detention, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled the case will remain in New Jersey because Khalil was in the state when his attorneys filed a habeas corpus motion seeking to challenge the legality of his detention, according to a 67-page decision filed Tuesday.

“The Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40am,” Farbiarz wrote. “And under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.”

Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East, was arrested in his Virginia home in mid-March after his J-1 visa was revoked.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Khan Suri was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” and that he had “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”

Like student detainees, Khan Suri has been accused of posing a threat to national security. He is currently being held in detention in Texas.

His defense team denies the US government claims and argues Khan Suri’s detainment is part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to clamp down on individuals “purportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,” according to his court petition.

Khan Suri’s attorney believes he’s being targeted also because his wife is a prominent Palestinian activist.

Khan Suri’s father-in-law, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political adviser to the prime minister of Gaza and as deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza until 2010, according to a court filing.

In a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, “We expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri’s) case fairly.”

Rümeysa Öztürk

Turkish national Rümeysa Öztürk was on her way to break the Ramadan fast in late March when she was arrested and physically restrained by six plainclothes officers near her apartment by Tufts University’s Somerville campus.

The arrest, which was captured on surveillance video, was described by Tufts President Sunil Kumar as “disturbing.”

In March 2024, the PhD student co-wrote an op-ed in the school’s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts’ response to a student government group’s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands.

When asked about Öztürk’s case, Rubio suggested, without evidence, that the 30-year-old participated in disruptive student protests over Israel’s military operations in Gaza.

A DHS spokesperson told CNN that Öztürk “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” but did not specify what those alleged activities were.

Öztürk is being held at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Homeland Security. While in transit to Louisiana, she suffered an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. Öztürk has also not been charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer.

On Friday, a judge in Boston ordered Öztürk not to be deported until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Öztürk was lawfully detained –– a decision that drew praise from Öztürk’s lawyers.

In a filing Tuesday, the US Attorney’s Office in Boston opposed Öztürk’s petition, saying the Boston court does not have jurisdiction in the case because the Tufts student was transferred out of the state shortly after her arrest.

Öztürk’s attorneys will file a response to the government’s opposition Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to an order by Judge Denise Casper.

Doğukan Günaydin

The University of Minnesota said in a campus-wide letter that an international graduate student was detained by immigration officials at an off-campus residence.

The university did not identify the student but called the arrest “a deeply concerning situation.”

The Turkish citizen was identified as Doğukan Günaydin in a lawsuit filed on his behalf this week, according to reporting from The Associated Press.

Günaydin, 28, is suing for his immediate release, saying his arrest violated his rights and he’s been given little explanation for why he’s being held, the lawsuit said. Two plainclothes federal officers arrested him on the street outside his St. Paul home while he was on his way to class Thursday.

“Doğukan feared he was being kidnapped as a man in a hooded sweatshirt grabbed him and handcuffed him,” according to his petition.

Günaydin’s attorney, Hannah Brown, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, but previously said this was a “highly sensitive situation.”

Monday, a senior DHS official told CNN the student was taken into custody because of a prior drunken driving incident.

“This is not related to student protests,” the official said in a statement Monday. “The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.”

Detaining an international student over a prior DUI conviction seems to suggest a different approach by immigration officials who, so far, appear focused on students who have participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war.

Günaydin’s detainment has drawn the ire of local, state and national leaders such as Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz –– all of whom are demanding answers from ICE.

“Snatching up students who come here legally to work hard and get an education does not make you tough on immigration,” Walz said in a post on social media. “We need answers.”

Before attending the University of Minnesota, Günaydin attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, a school spokesperson, Kat Dodge, told CNN on Wednesday.

Günaydin graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts in computer science and economics, Dodge said.

State Department orders additional screenings for some visa applicants

Outside the US, immigration officials have been ordered to conduct deeper scrutiny of visa applicants.

Over the weekend, the State Department sent out a memo ordering all US embassies and consulates to screen the social media activity of certain student visa applicants for evidence of support for terrorist organizations, two sources familiar with the memo told CNN.

The expansive directive, signed by Rubio, tasks “Fraud Prevention Units” at the State Department with taking screenshots of any social media activity that is relevant to the ineligibility of a visa applicant, and to preserve those records in case the applicant deletes the information, the sources said.

Decisions on visas are national security decisions, the memo says while citing executive orders from President Donald Trump to combat terrorism and antisemitism.

CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

Hundreds of students and recent graduates have seen their United States visas revoked by immigration officials since President Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20, and several have also been arrested.

Many of the targets of the visa revocations and arrests are students who participated in pro-Palestine protests that erupted on campuses across the country in 2024 during Israel’s war on Gaza. Others are individuals with more indirect links to Palestine or those who have shown support for Gaza on social media.

The Trump administration alleges that these students spread anti-Semitism and pro-Hamas sentiment on campus – a claim students, lawyers and activists have all rebutted. Jewish activists and groups have been at the forefront of many of the most prominent protests in the US against the Gaza war.

Others have had their visas cancelled after minor legal infractions – a speeding ticket or other traffic violations, for instance.

Here’s what we know about the scale of the visa revocations, the number of universities involved and some of the students who have been targeted:

How many students have had their visas revoked?

In late March, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration had revoked an estimated 300 student visas.

But the real number is higher – much higher.

Estimates vary. At the higher end is the American Immigration Lawyers Association’s count, according to which more than 4,700 students have been removed from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement-maintained database known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems.

Even more conservative tabulations point to a number comfortably more than 1,000. The National Association of Foreign Student Advisers estimates that as of Thursday, there are reports of about 1,400 students who now face deportation.

According to Inside Higher Ed, the US-based higher education publication, more than 1,680 students had lost their visas as of Monday.

How many universities have been affected?

According to Inside Higher Ed’s count, people at more than 250 universities and colleges across the US have had their student visas revoked.

Colleges affected include private universities such as Harvard and Stanford, large public colleges and institutions such as The Ohio State University and the University of Maryland as well as some small liberal arts colleges.

Why are the visas being revoked and what are the options?

The Trump administration says it is trying to stop activists from taking over campuses.

“We are not going to be importing activists into the United States. They’re here to study. They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine the – our universities,” Rubio said on March 28.

But many students have reported that they have had their legal status in the US terminated without any notice.

Several among them, like Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi and Momodou Taal, were active in pro-Palestine protests on campuses. Others had posted in support of Palestine on social media.

However, according to Mohammad Ali Syed, who leads an immigration practice group in Washington, DC, still others have had F-1 student visas revoked for past traffic violations or, in some cases, with no clear explanation.

“This widespread action has led to legal challenges and raised concerns about due process and the impact on US higher education institutions,” said Syed, who emphasised that international students ought to consult with immigration lawyers promptly to explore legal remedies and protect their rights.

“Students can file lawsuits in federal courts, asserting violations of due process and seeking to restore their legal status. For instance, students at Michigan universities have initiated legal actions against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging that their F-1 statuses were terminated without sufficient notice or explanation,” he said.

In urgent situations, he added, students may request temporary restraining orders to prevent deportation and reinstate their status while legal proceedings are ongoing. Federal judges in states like Montana have granted such orders to protect students from immediate removal, he said.

“Many universities are actively assisting affected students by providing legal resources, liaising with federal authorities and offering academic accommodations,” Syed said. “For example, George Mason University has engaged with federal officials to understand the rationale behind visa terminations and is exploring legal options to support its international students.”

How are visa cancellations affecting campuses?

Hafsa Kanjwal, an associate professor at Lafayette College, a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, says there is a large amount of fear and uncertainty on college campuses for both students and faculty. People are having to rethink travel plans in case they are not allowed back into the country.

“Some students and faculty don’t have a place to ‘go back’ to, given the political turmoil in their respective places of origin,” she told Al Jazeera. “While some colleges and universities are taking a more proactive approach, they are in the minority. It seems most campuses have not really provided reassurances to international students and faculty to address their concerns, especially around what kinds of accommodations will be made for them to address these changing developments.”

Another faculty member, a naturalised citizen at a state college who wished to remain anonymous due to any issues that may arise from him speaking freely, said international students are afraid.

Many of them – even those who have not staked out political positions publicly – are deleting their social media profiles and are terrified that some small mistake, anything they posted or said, might get them abducted and deported, ruining their education, he said.

“I remember being a green card holder and engaging in politics. We understood that as long as we remained within the bounds of the law, we had the right to express our opinions and engage in politics,” he recalled.

“I actively took part in [protests against] both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and spoke openly against ‘war on terror’ policies like drone strikes,” he said. “What the Trump administration wants to do is communicate to immigrants and international students that their rights here are in fact privileges and contingent on them staying in line, and more broadly they want to shut down pathways to immigration by targeting green card holders.

“At the same time, they see universities and colleges as bastions of liberal and left-wing politics, and they want to leverage the politics around Palestine to discipline universities and force them to crack down on liberal and left content in classrooms.”

Which students and graduates have been affected?

Mahmoud Khalil, 30

• Date of arrest: March 8

• Nationality: Palestinian Algerian

• Institution: Columbia University graduate

• Legal status in the US: green card holder

• How was he arrested? Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate who was the lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition of student groups, during the campus protests last year. He was taken from his university-owned New York City apartment while his US citizen wife, Noor Abdalla, who is pregnant, recorded the arrest on her phone. This marked the first publicly known student deportation effort of its kind under the Trump administration.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Tricia McLaughlin, alleged Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation”, but no evidence for this was provided. Abdalla said the agents did not show a warrant while making the arrest. Khalil was transferred to an ICE processing facility in Jena, Louisiana.

At the time of arrest, Khalil was a permanent resident with a green card. When the ICE agents were told that Khalil had a green card, they said this would be revoked.

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

However, Rubio posted a link to a news article about Khalil’s arrest, captioning it: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.” Khalil’s case has drawn widespread scrutiny as rights advocates accuse the Trump administration of cracking down on free speech and pro-Palestine activism under the guise of fighting anti-Semitism.

The administration is trying to deport Khalil under a rarely used provision of an immigration law that gives the secretary of state the power to remove any noncitizen whose presence in the US is deemed to have “adverse foreign policy consequences”.

Khalil is being held at LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana.

Rumeysa Ozturk, 30

• Date of arrest: March 26

• Nationality: Turkish

• Institution: Tufts University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• How was she arrested? Security camera footage shows six individuals in plainclothes taking Ozturk into custody in late March near her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. Some of these officers were partially covering their faces. Ozturk had headed out alone to meet her friends for iftar, the evening meal to break her Ramadan fast.

• Charges: She is not known to have been charged with any crime.

On March 26, 2024, Ozturk co-wrote an opinion piece for her university’s student news website, the Tufts Daily, with four other students. In this piece, the authors criticised the institution’s president, Sunil Kumar, who sent an email dismissing resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Union Senate, which called for the university to divest from companies linked to Israel and “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide”.

Ozturk’s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, filed a petition in a federal court in Boston, arguing that Ozturk had been unlawfully detained. As a result, US District Judge Indira Talwani ordered ICE not to move Ozturk out of Massachusetts without 48 hours notice.

Despite this, Ozturk was moved to Louisiana within a day, according to her lawyer.

McLaughlin wrote in an X post on March 26: “DHS + ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.” McLaughlin did not specify what these activities were.

On Saturday, a federal judge ordered the government to transfer Ozturk to Vermont for the court to assess legal challenges to her detention.

Badar Khan Suri, 42

• Date of arrest: March 17

• Nationality: Indian

• Institution: Georgetown University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• How was he arrested? He was arrested in the evening at his home in northern Virginia.

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

McLaughlin attributed Suri’s arrest to “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting anti-Semitism”. She wrote on X: “Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”

Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, is a US citizen, she confirmed to Al Jazeera. In a post on X on February 13, the Israeli embassy in the US said Saleh was the daughter of a senior Hamas adviser. Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, confirmed to The New York Times that he is Suri’s father-in-law.

On March 20, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles of the federal District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, halted Suri’s deportation.

According to the ICE website, Suri is currently being held in the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas.

Yunseo Chung, 21

• Date of arrest: March 5

• Nationality: South Korean

• Institution: Barnard, a Columbia-affiliated undergraduate college

• Legal status in the US: permanent resident

• How was she arrested? Chung was one of several students arrested by police officers for participating in a pro-Palestine protest.

• Charges: She is not known to have been charged with any crime.

She has sued the Trump administration in the US District Court in Manhattan to avoid being deported. Her deportation was halted by US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald.

Momodou Taal, 31

• Nationality: dual citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia

• Institution: was a doctoral candidate in Africana studies at Cornell University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

He participated in pro-Palestine protests last year, during which he called on Cornell to divest from companies that sell weapons to Israel. Taal was suspended from Cornell twice last year for his participation in protests, including an encampment. He has not been arrested but believes the US government had tried to arrest him.

Taal told Al Jazeera that he filed a lawsuit on March 8 with two other plaintiffs – a doctoral candidate and a Cornell professor who are both US citizens – after Khalil was arrested against two Trump executive orders, including one focused on university campuses.

On the morning of March 19, a day after a federal judge scheduled a hearing for Taal’s lawsuit, Taal posted a written statement on X that “unidentified law enforcement” had come to his home in Ithaca, New York. He added that later in the day, Cornell students saw additional law enforcement cars positioned at different spots near his residence, including on campus.

Taal left the US once his visa was revoked on March 14.

Alireza Doroudi, 32

• Date of arrest: March 25

• Nationality: Iranian

• Institution: University of Alabama

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• How was he arrested? He was taken into custody from his home

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

DHS stated his student visa was revoked and Doroudi was then arrested because he “posed significant national security concerns”.

Ranjani Srinivasan, 37

• Nationality: Indian

• Institution: Columbia University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• Charges: She is not known to have been charged with any crime.

On March 7, individuals claiming to be immigration agents knocked on Srinivasan’s university residential housing flat that she had lived in since 2021. The individuals said they planned to put Srinivasan through proceedings to remove her from the US before eventually leaving.

On March 9, Columbia unenrolled Srinivasan as a student.

By March 11, Srinivasan flew out of New York to Canada on a visitor visa to stay with family and friends. Her lawyers informed ICE that Srinivasan had departed from the US.

Leqaa Kordia, 21

• Date of arrest: March 13

• Nationality: Palestinian

• Institution: unknown

• Legal status in the US: overstayed a student visa

• Charges: The DHS said Kordia had overstayed her student visa, which had been terminated in 2022 “for lack of attendance”. In April 2024, she was arrested for her involvement in protests for Gaza at Columbia University.

Xiaotian Liu, 26

• Nationality: Chinese

• Institution: Dartmouth College

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which was revoked

• Charges: No known charges have been filed against Liu.

On April 3, Liu’s college ran a routine check on his legal status and discovered that his student visa had been revoked without notice.

The next day, the university informed him he could not continue with his computer science doctorate.

Liu said he has not been charged with any crime and did not take part in any protests.

He sued the US government along with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, alleging his visa had been revoked “without any notice and sufficient explanation”.

On April 9, a federal judge in New Hampshire halted the decision temporarily, saying she would block the Trump administration’s apparent revocation of Liu’s status.

Mohsen Mahdawi, 30

• Date of arrest: April 14

• Nationality: Palestinian

• Institution: Columbia University

• Legal status in the US: green card holder

• How was he arrested: Mahdawi was detained as he attended an interview at an immigration office regarding his application for citizenship, according to his lawyers.

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

Shortly after Mahdawi’s detention, District Judge William Sessions ordered that he must not be taken from the state of Vermont or the US. Mahdawi is the co-founder of a Palestinian student group at Columbia University alongside Khalil.

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/21/five-key-takeaways-tracking-student-visa,Five Key Takeaways From Tracking Student Visa Revocations,"On April 7, amid reports that the federal government was detaining international students and revoking their visas, Inside Higher Ed began collecting and cross-checking data in an effort to track exactly how many students were affected—and at which institutions. Our goal was to understand the scope of the federal government’s involvement in the visa process and what it means for international students and the colleges and universities they attend.

Over the past two weeks, more than 1,500 students—representing several hundred colleges and universities, as well as state systems—have had a sudden or unexpected change in their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) listing, or their F-1 or J-1 visa status.

<img src=""https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22668922/thumbnail"" width=""100%"" alt=""map visualization"">

The data we’ve gathered provides a snapshot of how the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security are acting on President Trump’s campaign promise to remove international students who engage in political activism or disrupt campus operations. But it also reveals some details about the students themselves.

Here’s what we know so far.

Our data set is growing, but still lacking.

When the map launched April 7, we identified 147 students, but that number quickly surpassed the figure Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited in a March 27 statement claiming that he had revoked 300 students’ visas. Various legal groups have suggested that the total is in the several thousands, so we expect our database to continue to grow.

From our own reporting—and the barrage of tips we received in our inboxes and over social media—we know that there are many more colleges and universities that have not disclosed information on the status of their international students. Most of them are small, private liberal arts colleges with large international student populations.

Why a college would choose not to disclose data is not entirely clear. Some say they’re protecting student identities; many are probably worried about the impact on future international student enrollment, which generates substantial tuition revenue for many institutions across the country.

At present, the database is mostly comprised of public regional or flagship colleges and universities. About 28 percent of the nearly 250 colleges are private. Additionally, the international student populations at the institutions vary, and the number of students affected doesn’t always align.

The University of Michigan, for example, has more than 8,000 foreign students but only reported 22 revocations. Meanwhile, Pima Community College in Arizona has fewer than 200 and reported one revocation. But then there’s Northwest Missouri State University, which had 716 international students as of October 2024 and reported 43 revocations.

As we scrape through individual student data in our set, about one-quarter of the 530 students analyzed so far have been identified as alumni, 8 percent as graduate students and 2 percent as undergraduates.

We don’t know much about the students themselves.

Student data is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, so any data we have gathered comes from one of a few sources: the student themselves, someone at the college or university with access to SEVIS, or a legal filing or lawyer representing the student in a lawsuit. No public database exists that provides international student visa data.

A few sources have disclosed more than just the number of students impacted; sometimes they share whether a student is currently enrolled or participating in Optional Practical Training—a program that allows F-1 visa holders to gain work experience related to their field of study—or OPT for STEM. Rarely do sources disclose the student’s nation of origin.

Of the 515 students whose data we’ve reviewed for nationality information, 450 do not have their nationality available. Of the 65 we have identified, 19 are from China, 15 are from India, five are from Kuwait, four are from Saudi Arabia, three are from Japan and two are from Turkey. The rest are a range of other nationalities.

One caveat: The higher numbers of Indian and Chinese students likely reflect their position as the top two countries of origin for foreign students enrolled at U.S. institutions. During the 2023–24 academic year, 331,602 Indian students and 277,398 Chinese students enrolled in postsecondary education in the U.S. By comparison, Canada sends roughly 28,000 students across the border each academic year.

This clearly isn’t just about antisemitism.

Initially, the State Department said it was targeting students who sought entrance to the U.S. “not just to study but to participate in movements that vandalize universities, harass students, take over buildings, and cause chaos.”

Some of the students impacted by visa revocations have been prominent social activists, including Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia University, who participated in pro-Palestinian protests and an encampment in spring 2024.

Columbia is among the colleges on our list—along with Emerson College, George Washington University, New York University, Northwestern University, the New School, Tufts University, the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of California, Berkeley—that saw large-scale campus protests and encampments this past spring.

Other campuses, however, saw little to no political engagement over the Israel-Hamas war. Webster University in St. Louis, for instance, had no noted examples of alleged antisemitism, yet 18 students had their visas revoked.

College officials say that several of the students affected weren’t involved in campus protests or considered student activists.

Officials often cite criminal activity as the rationale for revoking student visas.

International students may lose their legal standing in the U.S. for failing to meet the terms of their F-1 visa, which include being enrolled as a full-time student, not working off campus during their first year, having enough money to support themselves and maintaining a residence abroad.

But a student’s visa can also be revoked for more serious reasons, such as criminal activity, national security concerns, misrepresentation or fraud.

Some colleges and universities have said their students had visas revoked for past or minor crimes, including traffic violations, underage drinking and trespassing. Many of these cases were dismissed.

A growing number of students are suing the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security for revoking their visas. According to one lawsuit, the reason cited for students’ visa revocations was listed as “OTHER—Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated.”

Courts will likely have the final say on revocations.

So far, Inside Higher Ed has identified 28 lawsuits representing 178 students who are asking federal courts to restore their status in SEVIS and/or their visas. Several students have secured temporary restraining orders that allow them to stay in the country while the litigation continues, and at least one student had their visa reinstated.

The federal government has argued in court filings that the lawsuits should be dismissed because terminating a student’s SEVIS record doesn’t mean their visa is revoked or constitute a final action. SEVIS, a government attorney wrote, is simply a database and does not “control or even necessarily reflect whether a student has lawful nonimmigrant status.”

But some students aren’t waiting for the courts to weigh in. At least five have left the country voluntarily, according to news reports. And others never got the chance to file suit before the federal government took action. Fewer than 10 students have been arrested, detained or deported.

Here’s what we know,"At least 70 students attending New York universities and colleges have had their student visas revoked by the Trump administration, according to several school officials.

Some of the cancellations, which overall reflect a small percentage of the estimated 1.5 million international students studying in the United States, according to USA TODAY, appear to be connected to things as minor as roommate disputes or as off-campus traffic tickets, while others appear to be connected to pro-Palestinian protest participation.

The American Council on Education and 15 other higher ed groups have requested a briefing from federal officials and the National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations.

Here's the latest.

Why are student visas being revoked?

As for the revocation of student visas, the only direct explanation from the U.S. Department of State is vague: ""To keep our community safe.""

""Well, we’ve never gone into the details of the visa process,"" Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an April 8 press conference.

""We don’t discuss individual visas because of the privacy issues involved. We don’t go into statistics or numbers; we don’t go into the rationale for what happens with individual visas. What we can tell you is that the department revokes visas every day in order to secure our borders and to keep our community safe, and we’ll continue to do so.""

There are many legal reasons why a student could have their visa revoked, such as expulsion, unauthorized employment or ""otherwise failing to maintain status.""

SEVIS is the online system that the Department of Homeland Security uses to track F-1 and M-1 students' status.

How many students have had their visa revoked?

It's unclear because the Trump administration won't say.

NAFSA reported on April 10 that there have been ""almost 1,000 reports of international students and scholars either having their visa revoked and/or their record in SEVIS terminated.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that he's revoked at least 300 visas of students he described as ""lunatics,"" citing pro-Palestinian support or activism, activities that are normally considered protected First Amendment rights, USA TODAY reported.

""It might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,"" Rubio said at a press conference.
