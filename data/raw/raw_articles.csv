Nearly a dozen students and faculty members at colleges across the country are known to have been detained by federal agents amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, which on college campuses, has taken aim at pro-Palestinian student activists and Israel critics.

Many of those detained have been granted the right to live in the US either as permanent residents or through temporary work or student visas. Their rights, however, have been put into question under new, sweeping immigration orders that some legal experts fear may be used liberally to clamp down on dissent.

Speaking to reporters last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said under his direction, more than 300 visas –– “primarily student visas, some visitor visas” –– have been revoked. Rubio did not specify how many visas belonged to people tied to the pro-Palestinian movement.

“If they’re taking activities that are counter to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we’ll revoke the visa,” Rubio said.

When asked about freedom of speech concerns, Rubio said international students are “here to study.”

“They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it’s lunacy to continue to allow that.”

Here is what we know about the detainment of college activists, students and scholars.

Mahmoud Khalil

Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs and one of the school’s most prominent pro-Palestinian activists, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

He was arrested by federal agents March 8 and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration.

The administration ordered Khalil to be deported after baselessly claiming he is a Hamas sympathizer, a threat to national security, and poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Officials later said Khalil’s deportation was justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident –– an argument his attorneys call weak.

On March 19, a judge blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred his case to New Jersey.

While Department of Justice officials have sought to keep Khalil’s case in Louisiana since his detention, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled the case will remain in New Jersey because Khalil was in the state when his attorneys filed a habeas corpus motion seeking to challenge the legality of his detention, according to a 67-page decision filed Tuesday.

“The Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40am,” Farbiarz wrote. “And under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.”

Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East, was arrested in his Virginia home in mid-March after his J-1 visa was revoked.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Khan Suri was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” and that he had “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”

Like student detainees, Khan Suri has been accused of posing a threat to national security. He is currently being held in detention in Texas.

His defense team denies the US government claims and argues Khan Suri’s detainment is part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to clamp down on individuals “purportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,” according to his court petition.

Khan Suri’s attorney believes he’s being targeted also because his wife is a prominent Palestinian activist.

Khan Suri’s father-in-law, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political adviser to the prime minister of Gaza and as deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza until 2010, according to a court filing.

In a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, “We expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri’s) case fairly.”

Rümeysa Öztürk

Turkish national Rümeysa Öztürk was on her way to break the Ramadan fast in late March when she was arrested and physically restrained by six plainclothes officers near her apartment by Tufts University’s Somerville campus.

The arrest, which was captured on surveillance video, was described by Tufts President Sunil Kumar as “disturbing.”

In March 2024, the PhD student co-wrote an op-ed in the school’s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts’ response to a student government group’s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands.

When asked about Öztürk’s case, Rubio suggested, without evidence, that the 30-year-old participated in disruptive student protests over Israel’s military operations in Gaza.

A DHS spokesperson told CNN that Öztürk “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” but did not specify what those alleged activities were.

Öztürk is being held at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Homeland Security. While in transit to Louisiana, she suffered an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. Öztürk has also not been charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer.

On Friday, a judge in Boston ordered Öztürk not to be deported until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Öztürk was lawfully detained –– a decision that drew praise from Öztürk’s lawyers.

In a filing Tuesday, the US Attorney’s Office in Boston opposed Öztürk’s petition, saying the Boston court does not have jurisdiction in the case because the Tufts student was transferred out of the state shortly after her arrest.

Öztürk’s attorneys will file a response to the government’s opposition Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to an order by Judge Denise Casper.

Doğukan Günaydin

The University of Minnesota said in a campus-wide letter that an international graduate student was detained by immigration officials at an off-campus residence.

The university did not identify the student but called the arrest “a deeply concerning situation.”

The Turkish citizen was identified as Doğukan Günaydin in a lawsuit filed on his behalf this week, according to reporting from The Associated Press.

Günaydin, 28, is suing for his immediate release, saying his arrest violated his rights and he’s been given little explanation for why he’s being held, the lawsuit said. Two plainclothes federal officers arrested him on the street outside his St. Paul home while he was on his way to class Thursday.

“Doğukan feared he was being kidnapped as a man in a hooded sweatshirt grabbed him and handcuffed him,” according to his petition.

Günaydin’s attorney, Hannah Brown, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, but previously said this was a “highly sensitive situation.”

Monday, a senior DHS official told CNN the student was taken into custody because of a prior drunken driving incident.

“This is not related to student protests,” the official said in a statement Monday. “The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.”

Detaining an international student over a prior DUI conviction seems to suggest a different approach by immigration officials who, so far, appear focused on students who have participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war.

Günaydin’s detainment has drawn the ire of local, state and national leaders such as Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz –– all of whom are demanding answers from ICE.

“Snatching up students who come here legally to work hard and get an education does not make you tough on immigration,” Walz said in a post on social media. “We need answers.”

Before attending the University of Minnesota, Günaydin attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, a school spokesperson, Kat Dodge, told CNN on Wednesday.

Günaydin graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts in computer science and economics, Dodge said.

Other students and scholars targeted

Rasha Alawieh, an assistant professor with a valid US visa at Brown Medical School, was deported from Boston to Lebanon after federal agents discovered she attended former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral in February. Alawieh acknowledged she supported Nasrallah’s religious and spiritual techniques but not his politics. A lawyer representing the professor via a family member is working to bring her back to the country.

State Department orders additional screenings for some visa applicants

Outside the US, immigration officials have been ordered to conduct deeper scrutiny of visa applicants.

Over the weekend, the State Department sent out a memo ordering all US embassies and consulates to screen the social media activity of certain student visa applicants for evidence of support for terrorist organizations, two sources familiar with the memo told CNN.

The expansive directive, signed by Rubio, tasks “Fraud Prevention Units” at the State Department with taking screenshots of any social media activity that is relevant to the ineligibility of a visa applicant, and to preserve those records in case the applicant deletes the information, the sources said.

Decisions on visas are national security decisions, the memo says while citing executive orders from President Donald Trump to combat terrorism and antisemitism.

CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

CNN’s Gloria Pazmino and Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.

Hundreds of students and recent graduates have seen their United States visas revoked by immigration officials since President Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20, and several have also been arrested.

Many of the targets of the visa revocations and arrests are students who participated in pro-Palestine protests that erupted on campuses across the country in 2024 during Israel’s war on Gaza. Others are individuals with more indirect links to Palestine or those who have shown support for Gaza on social media.

The Trump administration alleges that these students spread anti-Semitism and pro-Hamas sentiment on campus – a claim students, lawyers and activists have all rebutted. Jewish activists and groups have been at the forefront of many of the most prominent protests in the US against the Gaza war.

Others have had their visas cancelled after minor legal infractions – a speeding ticket or other traffic violations, for instance.

Here’s what we know about the scale of the visa revocations, the number of universities involved and some of the students who have been targeted:

How many students have had their visas revoked?

In late March, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration had revoked an estimated 300 student visas.

But the real number is higher – much higher.

Estimates vary. At the higher end is the American Immigration Lawyers Association’s count, according to which more than 4,700 students have been removed from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement-maintained database known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems.

Even more conservative tabulations point to a number comfortably more than 1,000. The National Association of Foreign Student Advisers estimates that as of Thursday, there are reports of about 1,400 students who now face deportation.

According to Inside Higher Ed, the US-based higher education publication, more than 1,680 students had lost their visas as of Monday.

How many universities have been affected?

According to Inside Higher Ed’s count, people at more than 250 universities and colleges across the US have had their student visas revoked.

Colleges affected include private universities such as Harvard and Stanford, large public colleges and institutions such as The Ohio State University and the University of Maryland as well as some small liberal arts colleges.

Why are the visas being revoked and what are the options?

The Trump administration says it is trying to stop activists from taking over campuses.

“We are not going to be importing activists into the United States. They’re here to study. They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine the – our universities,” Rubio said on March 28.

But many students have reported that they have had their legal status in the US terminated without any notice.

Several among them, like Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi and Momodou Taal, were active in pro-Palestine protests on campuses. Others had posted in support of Palestine on social media.

However, according to Mohammad Ali Syed, who leads an immigration practice group in Washington, DC, still others have had F-1 student visas revoked for past traffic violations or, in some cases, with no clear explanation.

“This widespread action has led to legal challenges and raised concerns about due process and the impact on US higher education institutions,” said Syed, who emphasised that international students ought to consult with immigration lawyers promptly to explore legal remedies and protect their rights.

“Students can file lawsuits in federal courts, asserting violations of due process and seeking to restore their legal status. For instance, students at Michigan universities have initiated legal actions against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging that their F-1 statuses were terminated without sufficient notice or explanation,” he said.

In urgent situations, he added, students may request temporary restraining orders to prevent deportation and reinstate their status while legal proceedings are ongoing. Federal judges in states like Montana have granted such orders to protect students from immediate removal, he said.

“Many universities are actively assisting affected students by providing legal resources, liaising with federal authorities and offering academic accommodations,” Syed said. “For example, George Mason University has engaged with federal officials to understand the rationale behind visa terminations and is exploring legal options to support its international students.”

How are visa cancellations affecting campuses?

Hafsa Kanjwal, an associate professor at Lafayette College, a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, says there is a large amount of fear and uncertainty on college campuses for both students and faculty. People are having to rethink travel plans in case they are not allowed back into the country.

“Some students and faculty don’t have a place to ‘go back’ to, given the political turmoil in their respective places of origin,” she told Al Jazeera. “While some colleges and universities are taking a more proactive approach, they are in the minority. It seems most campuses have not really provided reassurances to international students and faculty to address their concerns, especially around what kinds of accommodations will be made for them to address these changing developments.”

Another faculty member, a naturalised citizen at a state college who wished to remain anonymous due to any issues that may arise from him speaking freely, said international students are afraid.

Many of them – even those who have not staked out political positions publicly – are deleting their social media profiles and are terrified that some small mistake, anything they posted or said, might get them abducted and deported, ruining their education, he said.

“I remember being a green card holder and engaging in politics. We understood that as long as we remained within the bounds of the law, we had the right to express our opinions and engage in politics,” he recalled.

“I actively took part in [protests against] both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and spoke openly against ‘war on terror’ policies like drone strikes,” he said. “What the Trump administration wants to do is communicate to immigrants and international students that their rights here are in fact privileges and contingent on them staying in line, and more broadly they want to shut down pathways to immigration by targeting green card holders.

“At the same time, they see universities and colleges as bastions of liberal and left-wing politics, and they want to leverage the politics around Palestine to discipline universities and force them to crack down on liberal and left content in classrooms.”

Which students and graduates have been affected?

Mahmoud Khalil, 30

• Date of arrest: March 8

• Nationality: Palestinian Algerian

• Institution: Columbia University graduate

• Legal status in the US: green card holder

• How was he arrested? Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate who was the lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition of student groups, during the campus protests last year. He was taken from his university-owned New York City apartment while his US citizen wife, Noor Abdalla, who is pregnant, recorded the arrest on her phone. This marked the first publicly known student deportation effort of its kind under the Trump administration.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Tricia McLaughlin, alleged Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation”, but no evidence for this was provided. Abdalla said the agents did not show a warrant while making the arrest. Khalil was transferred to an ICE processing facility in Jena, Louisiana.

At the time of arrest, Khalil was a permanent resident with a green card. When the ICE agents were told that Khalil had a green card, they said this would be revoked.

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

However, Rubio posted a link to a news article about Khalil’s arrest, captioning it: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.” Khalil’s case has drawn widespread scrutiny as rights advocates accuse the Trump administration of cracking down on free speech and pro-Palestine activism under the guise of fighting anti-Semitism.

The administration is trying to deport Khalil under a rarely used provision of an immigration law that gives the secretary of state the power to remove any noncitizen whose presence in the US is deemed to have “adverse foreign policy consequences”.

Khalil is being held at LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana.

Rumeysa Ozturk, 30

• Date of arrest: March 26

• Nationality: Turkish

• Institution: Tufts University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• How was she arrested? Security camera footage shows six individuals in plainclothes taking Ozturk into custody in late March near her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. Some of these officers were partially covering their faces. Ozturk had headed out alone to meet her friends for iftar, the evening meal to break her Ramadan fast.

• Charges: She is not known to have been charged with any crime.

On March 26, 2024, Ozturk co-wrote an opinion piece for her university’s student news website, the Tufts Daily, with four other students. In this piece, the authors criticised the institution’s president, Sunil Kumar, who sent an email dismissing resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Union Senate, which called for the university to divest from companies linked to Israel and “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide”.

Ozturk’s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, filed a petition in a federal court in Boston, arguing that Ozturk had been unlawfully detained. As a result, US District Judge Indira Talwani ordered ICE not to move Ozturk out of Massachusetts without 48 hours notice.

Despite this, Ozturk was moved to Louisiana within a day, according to her lawyer.

McLaughlin wrote in an X post on March 26: “DHS + ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.” McLaughlin did not specify what these activities were.

On Saturday, a federal judge ordered the government to transfer Ozturk to Vermont for the court to assess legal challenges to her detention.

Badar Khan Suri, 42

• Date of arrest: March 17

• Nationality: Indian

• Institution: Georgetown University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• How was he arrested? He was arrested in the evening at his home in northern Virginia.

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

McLaughlin attributed Suri’s arrest to “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting anti-Semitism”. She wrote on X: “Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”

Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, is a US citizen, she confirmed to Al Jazeera. In a post on X on February 13, the Israeli embassy in the US said Saleh was the daughter of a senior Hamas adviser. Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, confirmed to The New York Times that he is Suri’s father-in-law.

On March 20, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles of the federal District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, halted Suri’s deportation.

According to the ICE website, Suri is currently being held in the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas.

Yunseo Chung, 21

• Date of arrest: March 5

• Nationality: South Korean

• Institution: Barnard, a Columbia-affiliated undergraduate college

• Legal status in the US: permanent resident

• How was she arrested? Chung was one of several students arrested by police officers for participating in a pro-Palestine protest.

• Charges: She is not known to have been charged with any crime.

She has sued the Trump administration in the US District Court in Manhattan to avoid being deported. Her deportation was halted by US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald.

Momodou Taal, 31

• Nationality: dual citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia

• Institution: was a doctoral candidate in Africana studies at Cornell University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

He participated in pro-Palestine protests last year, during which he called on Cornell to divest from companies that sell weapons to Israel. Taal was suspended from Cornell twice last year for his participation in protests, including an encampment. He has not been arrested but believes the US government had tried to arrest him.

Taal told Al Jazeera that he filed a lawsuit on March 8 with two other plaintiffs – a doctoral candidate and a Cornell professor who are both US citizens – after Khalil was arrested against two Trump executive orders, including one focused on university campuses.

On the morning of March 19, a day after a federal judge scheduled a hearing for Taal’s lawsuit, Taal posted a written statement on X that “unidentified law enforcement” had come to his home in Ithaca, New York. He added that later in the day, Cornell students saw additional law enforcement cars positioned at different spots near his residence, including on campus.

Taal left the US once his visa was revoked on March 14.

Alireza Doroudi, 32

• Date of arrest: March 25

• Nationality: Iranian

• Institution: University of Alabama

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• How was he arrested? He was taken into custody from his home

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

DHS stated his student visa was revoked and Doroudi was then arrested because he “posed significant national security concerns”.

Ranjani Srinivasan, 37

• Nationality: Indian

• Institution: Columbia University

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which has been revoked

• Charges: She is not known to have been charged with any crime.

On March 7, individuals claiming to be immigration agents knocked on Srinivasan’s university residential housing flat that she had lived in since 2021. The individuals said they planned to put Srinivasan through proceedings to remove her from the US before eventually leaving.

On March 9, Columbia unenrolled Srinivasan as a student.

By March 11, Srinivasan flew out of New York to Canada on a visitor visa to stay with family and friends. Her lawyers informed ICE that Srinivasan had departed from the US.

Leqaa Kordia, 21

• Date of arrest: March 13

• Nationality: Palestinian

• Institution: unknown

• Legal status in the US: overstayed a student visa

• Charges: The DHS said Kordia had overstayed her student visa, which had been terminated in 2022 “for lack of attendance”. In April 2024, she was arrested for her involvement in protests for Gaza at Columbia University.

Xiaotian Liu, 26

• Nationality: Chinese

• Institution: Dartmouth College

• Legal status in the US: student visa, which was revoked

• Charges: No known charges have been filed against Liu.

On April 3, Liu’s college ran a routine check on his legal status and discovered that his student visa had been revoked without notice.

The next day, the university informed him he could not continue with his computer science doctorate.

Liu said he has not been charged with any crime and did not take part in any protests.

He sued the US government along with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, alleging his visa had been revoked “without any notice and sufficient explanation”.

On April 9, a federal judge in New Hampshire halted the decision temporarily, saying she would block the Trump administration’s apparent revocation of Liu’s status.

Mohsen Mahdawi, 30

• Date of arrest: April 14

Advertisement

• Nationality: Palestinian

• Institution: Columbia University

• Legal status in the US: green card holder

• How was he arrested: Mahdawi was detained as he attended an interview at an immigration office regarding his application for citizenship, according to his lawyers.

• Charges: He is not known to have been charged with any crime.

Shortly after Mahdawi’s detention, District Judge William Sessions ordered that he must not be taken from the state of Vermont or the US. Mahdawi is the co-founder of a Palestinian student group at Columbia University alongside Khalil.

It is unclear where he is being held."
https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/21/five-key-takeaways-tracking-student-visa,Five Key Takeaways From Tracking Student Visa Revocations,"On April 7, amid reports that the federal government was detaining international students and revoking their visas, Inside Higher Ed began collecting and cross-checking data in an effort to track exactly how many students were affected—and at which institutions. Our goal was to understand the scope of the federal government’s involvement in the visa process and what it means for international students and the colleges and universities they attend.

Over the past two weeks, more than 1,500 students—representing several hundred colleges and universities, as well as state systems—have had a sudden or unexpected change in their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) listing, or their F-1 or J-1 visa status.

<img src=""https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22668922/thumbnail"" width=""100%"" alt=""map visualization"">

The data we’ve gathered provides a snapshot of how the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security are acting on President Trump’s campaign promise to remove international students who engage in political activism or disrupt campus operations. But it also reveals some details about the students themselves.

Here’s what we know so far.

Our data set is growing, but still lacking.

When the map launched April 7, we identified 147 students, but that number quickly surpassed the figure Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited in a March 27 statement claiming that he had revoked 300 students’ visas. Various legal groups have suggested that the total is in the several thousands, so we expect our database to continue to grow.

From our own reporting—and the barrage of tips we received in our inboxes and over social media—we know that there are many more colleges and universities that have not disclosed information on the status of their international students. Most of them are small, private liberal arts colleges with large international student populations.

Why a college would choose not to disclose data is not entirely clear. Some say they’re protecting student identities; many are probably worried about the impact on future international student enrollment, which generates substantial tuition revenue for many institutions across the country.

At present, the database is mostly comprised of public regional or flagship colleges and universities. About 28 percent of the nearly 250 colleges are private. Additionally, the international student populations at the institutions vary, and the number of students affected doesn’t always align.

The University of Michigan, for example, has more than 8,000 foreign students but only reported 22 revocations. Meanwhile, Pima Community College in Arizona has fewer than 200 and reported one revocation. But then there’s Northwest Missouri State University, which had 716 international students as of October 2024 and reported 43 revocations.

As we scrape through individual student data in our set, about one-quarter of the 530 students analyzed so far have been identified as alumni, 8 percent as graduate students and 2 percent as undergraduates.

We don’t know much about the students themselves.

Student data is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, so any data we have gathered comes from one of a few sources: the student themselves, someone at the college or university with access to SEVIS, or a legal filing or lawyer representing the student in a lawsuit. No public database exists that provides international student visa data.

A few sources have disclosed more than just the number of students impacted; sometimes they share whether a student is currently enrolled or participating in Optional Practical Training—a program that allows F-1 visa holders to gain work experience related to their field of study—or OPT for STEM. Rarely do sources disclose the student’s nation of origin.

Of the 515 students whose data we’ve reviewed for nationality information, 450 do not have their nationality available. Of the 65 we have identified, 19 are from China, 15 are from India, five are from Kuwait, four are from Saudi Arabia, three are from Japan and two are from Turkey. The rest are a range of other nationalities.

One caveat: The higher numbers of Indian and Chinese students likely reflect their position as the top two countries of origin for foreign students enrolled at U.S. institutions. During the 2023–24 academic year, 331,602 Indian students and 277,398 Chinese students enrolled in postsecondary education in the U.S. By comparison, Canada sends roughly 28,000 students across the border each academic year.

This clearly isn’t just about antisemitism.

Initially, the State Department said it was targeting students who sought entrance to the U.S. “not just to study but to participate in movements that vandalize universities, harass students, take over buildings, and cause chaos.”

Some of the students impacted by visa revocations have been prominent social activists, including Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia University, who participated in pro-Palestinian protests and an encampment in spring 2024.

Columbia is among the colleges on our list—along with Emerson College, George Washington University, New York University, Northwestern University, the New School, Tufts University, the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of California, Berkeley—that saw large-scale campus protests and encampments this past spring.

Other campuses, however, saw little to no political engagement over the Israel-Hamas war. Webster University in St. Louis, for instance, had no noted examples of alleged antisemitism, yet 18 students had their visas revoked.

College officials say that several of the students affected weren’t involved in campus protests or considered student activists.

Officials often cite criminal activity as the rationale for revoking student visas.

International students may lose their legal standing in the U.S. for failing to meet the terms of their F-1 visa, which include being enrolled as a full-time student, not working off campus during their first year, having enough money to support themselves and maintaining a residence abroad.

But a student’s visa can also be revoked for more serious reasons, such as criminal activity, national security concerns, misrepresentation or fraud.

Some colleges and universities have said their students had visas revoked for past or minor crimes, including traffic violations, underage drinking and trespassing. Many of these cases were dismissed.

A growing number of students are suing the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security for revoking their visas. According to one lawsuit, the reason cited for students’ visa revocations was listed as “OTHER—Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated.”

Courts will likely have the final say on revocations.

So far, Inside Higher Ed has identified 28 lawsuits representing 178 students who are asking federal courts to restore their status in SEVIS and/or their visas. Several students have secured temporary restraining orders that allow them to stay in the country while the litigation continues, and at least one student had their visa reinstated.

The federal government has argued in court filings that the lawsuits should be dismissed because terminating a student’s SEVIS record doesn’t mean their visa is revoked or constitute a final action. SEVIS, a government attorney wrote, is simply a database and does not “control or even necessarily reflect whether a student has lawful nonimmigrant status.”

But some students aren’t waiting for the courts to weigh in. At least five have left the country voluntarily, according to news reports. And others never got the chance to file suit before the federal government took action. Fewer than 10 students have been arrested, detained or deported.

We’re adding to our student-level database and continuing to update the map, so check back here for daily updates. As we learn more about those affected, we’ll share that data, too."

Here’s what we know,"At least 70 students attending New York universities and colleges have had their student visas revoked by the Trump administration, according to several school officials.

Some of the cancellations, which overall reflect a small percentage of the estimated 1.5 million international students studying in the United States, according to USA TODAY, appear to be connected to things as minor as roommate disputes or as off-campus traffic tickets, while others appear to be connected to pro-Palestinian protest participation.

The American Council on Education and 15 other higher ed groups have requested a briefing from federal officials and the National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations.

Here's the latest.

Why are student visas being revoked?

As for the revocation of student visas, the only direct explanation from the U.S. Department of State is vague: ""To keep our community safe.""

""Well, we’ve never gone into the details of the visa process,"" Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an April 8 press conference.

""We don’t discuss individual visas because of the privacy issues involved. We don’t go into statistics or numbers; we don’t go into the rationale for what happens with individual visas. What we can tell you is that the department revokes visas every day in order to secure our borders and to keep our community safe, and we’ll continue to do so.""

There are many legal reasons why a student could have their visa revoked, such as expulsion, unauthorized employment or ""otherwise failing to maintain status.""

What is an F-1 visa?

An F-1 is a type of nonimmigrant student visa that allows international students to enter the U.S. to pursue full-time academic studies in an accredited program, according to the State Department.

What is an M-1 visa?

An M-1 visa is similar to an F-1 visa, but for nonimmigrants to enroll in a vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution rather than a full-time academic program.

What happens if a student visa is revoked?

The student must leave the country immediately or risk deportation if the status of the student's visa is changed in the government's Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database.

What is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System?

SEVIS is the online system that the Department of Homeland Security uses to track F-1 and M-1 students' status.

How many students have had their visa revoked?

It's unclear because the Trump administration won't say.

NAFSA reported on April 10 that there have been ""almost 1,000 reports of international students and scholars either having their visa revoked and/or their record in SEVIS terminated.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that he's revoked at least 300 visas of students he described as ""lunatics,"" citing pro-Palestinian support or activism, activities that are normally considered protected First Amendment rights, USA TODAY reported.

""It might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,"" Rubio said at a press conference.

https://time.com/7272060/international-students-targeted-trump-ice-detention-deport-campus-palestinian-activism/,These Are the Students Targeted by ICE So Far,"A husband and expectant father; a former high school valedictorian; an architect and adjunct professor of urban planning, and a former Fulbright Scholar with a passion for child education. All legally residing in the U.S. They’re also just some of the targets of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in recent weeks as part of a campaign by President Donald Trump’s Administration to detain and deport noncitizens over their pro-Palestinian campus activism.

“This is the first arrest of many to come,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, following the arrest of Palestinian graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. “If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply.” At least 300 international students who are “destabilizing” college campuses have had their visas revoked, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at a press conference on March 27. “Maybe more, it might be more than 300 at this point,” Rubio said. “At some point I hope we run out because we’ve gotten rid of all of them, but we’re looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up.” The effort has raised questions about free speech and the rights of legal noncitizens, and it’s prompted legal challenges and protests in support of the targeted students.

CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a post on X on March 31 that, when asked about the evidence against the international students being targeted, a senior state official told him on background that “every individual who has had their visa recently revoked by this administration has displayed problematic behavior that would have made them ineligible for a visa if they would have disclosed this information during the vetting process.” The effort has raised questions about free speech and the rights of legal noncitizens, and it’s prompted legal challenges and protests in support of the targeted students. Here’s what we know about some of the students who have been targeted by ICE so far: A student at Minnesota State University, Mankato An international student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, was detained at an off-campus residence on March 28, the school’s president Edward Inch said in a campus-wide email on March 31, without naming the student.

According to the school’s student newspaper, no reason was given for the student’s arrest and the university had not received any information from ICE. “Our international students play an important role in our campus and community,” the statement said. “This actions hurts what we try to accomplish as a university—supporting all learners to receive the education they desire to make the impact they want in their communities.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz posted on X that he is working to get more information from DHS, after another international student in Minnesota was detained on March 27. “The University of Minnesota is an international destination for education and research,” he wrote. “We have any number of students studying here with visas, and we need answers.” Rumeysa Ozturk A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled on March 28 that Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk can’t be deported without a court order. Ozturk, 30, was on a valid F-1 visa for her PhD studies at Tufts University in Boston when she became another high-profile target of ICE after her arrest, which witnesses caught on video, outside her home in Somerville, Mass., on the night of March 25.

Ozturk was walking alone on a sidewalk, on her way back home after meeting friends for iftar, a meal to break fast at sunset during Ramadan, when a plainsclothes officer, wearing a hat and a hoodie, approached her, surveillance video obtained from a neighbor and posted on X on Wednesday shows. The officer grabbed Ozturk by the arms, causing her to yell out, before five other plainsclothes officers approached her. One officer pulled out a concealed badge and confiscated her cell phone. The officers told her, “We’re the police.” A person off camera could be heard saying, “You don’t look like it, why are you hiding your faces? How do I know this is the police?” while the officers—who wore cloth face masks—escorted Ozturk to a black SUV. The entire encounter lasted just under two minutes.

Ozturk obtained a degree in psychology and Turkish language and literature from Istanbul Şehir University before coming to the U.S. in 2018 on a Fulbright Scholarship to earn a master’s in developmental and child psychology from Columbia University’s Teachers College, according to her LinkedIn. Passionate about children’s media and education, her LinkedIn says, she’s published research into the representation of refugee characters in children’s animated TV, interned at a consulting firm advising entertainment studios on children’s content and development, and taught courses on media and education to high school students. Last year, Ozturk co-authored an op-ed in Tufts’ student newspaper, The Tufts Daily, backing the Tufts Community Union Senate’s call for the university to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide, … dislose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.”

After she was detained, Ozturk’s attorney filed a petition asking that Ozturk remain held in Massachusetts, which was granted. Nevertheless, ICE transferred her to Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, which is notorious for unsanitary conditions, harsh punitive measures, and “a culture of abuse,” according to CNN and the ACLU. Jeff Migliozzi, communications director for advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, told CNN that ICE detention centers are intentionally remotely located, making them “effectively black boxes.” Judge Denise Casper gave the government until April 1 to respond to an updated complaint filed by Ozturk’s attorneys. In the meantime, the government cannot deport her without a court order while her case is being heard. “No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of,” Ozturk’s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, told the AP. The Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement on X that the embassy is monitoring Ozturk’s situation and is in touch with the State Department and ICE.

Yunseo Chung ICE cannot arrest 21-year-old Yunseo Chung, a judge ruled on March 25, granting a temporary restraining order against the government after her attorneys filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration for trying to deport her in spite of her legal status. “After the constant dread in the back of my mind over the past few weeks, this decision feels like a million pounds off of my chest. I feel like I could fly,” Chung said in a statement provided to TIME. “I’m so, so grateful to my legal team and my community of professors, students, and staff at Columbia that have given me strength at every turn.”

At seven years old, Chung emigrated to the U.S. with her family from South Korea and became a lawful permanent resident, according to the lawsuit. She was valedictorian at her high school and enrolled in 2022 at Columbia University, where she was studying English and gender studies. The 21-year-old reportedly attended—but was not a leader of—a sit-in at Barnard College protesting the expulsion of students who had participated in pro-Palestinian activism on March 5, according to the lawsuit. When an apparent white supremacist bomb threat was called (later determined to be a hoax), police officers instructed protesters to exit the building. Chung was caught in the rush to exit, the lawsuit says, and was arrested, charged with obstruction of governmental administration, given a “desk appearance ticket,” and released. She was suspended from Columbia as a result of the arrest on March 7. On March 9, ICE agents searched her parents’ home in an attempt to find her, the lawsuit alleges. The agents also obtained a warrant against “harboring noncitizens” to search her Columbia dormitory. A law enforcement official told her lawyer that her permanent resident status was being revoked.

A DHS spokesperson told the Columbia Spectator, Columbia’s student newspaper, that Chung “engaged in concerning conduct, including when she was arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College. She is being sought for removal proceedings under the immigration laws.” Chung had previously participated in, but not organized or led, protests and events at the Gaza Solidary Encampment on Columbia’s campus last spring, according to the lawsuit. She also faced disciplinary proceedings from Columbia for vandalism after putting up posters with photos of members of Columbia’s Board of Trustees with the words, “Wanted for Complicity in Genocide.” After a review, the university found Chung had not violated any policies, the lawsuit says. The complaint filed by Chung’s attorneys alleges that the administration is demonstrating a “pattern and practice of targeting individuals associated with protests for Palestinian rights for immigration enforcement” and described the government’s actions as an “unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights…” As of March 31, the Trump Administration has not appealed the temporary restraining order.

“Yunseo no longer has to fear that ICE will spirit her away to a distant prison simply because she spoke up for Palestinian human rights,” Ramzi Kassem, one of Chung’s lawyers, said in a statement to TIME. “The court’s temporary restraining order is both sensible and fair, to preserve the status quo as we litigate the serious constitutional issues at stake not just for Yunseo, but for our society as a whole.” Badar Khan Suri Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen studying and teaching at Georgetown University on a valid J-1 visa, was detained by ICE on March 17.

Suri, who lives in Arlington, Va., was, like Ozturk, approached by masked men outside his home after an iftar gathering. Suri’s lawyer, Nermeen Arastu, told CNN that the officers were “brandishing weapons.” The agents identified themselves as members of DHS and told Suri that the government had revoked his visa, according to a lawsuit filed for his immediate release. The lawsuit alleges that the government is seeking to deport Suri under a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the Secretary of State the authority to deport noncitizens for whom the Secretary has “reasonable ground to believe” their presence or activities in the U.S. “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”

“During his time on campus, I am not aware that Dr. Suri has engaged in any illegal activity, nor has he posed a threat to the security of our campus. He has been focused on completing his research,” Joel Hellman, dean of Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, wrote in a statement on March 21. Suri has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime, according to the lawsuit. Rather, the lawsuit alleges Suri has been targeted because his wife, a U.S. citizen, is of Palestinian heritage and because of her past “constitutionally protected free speech.” The couple has “long been doxxed and smeared,” the petition says, including being posted on an anonymously-run blacklisting website. Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown, told Democracy Now! That Suri is “not a political activist. He was just a very serious young academic focusing on his teaching and his research.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed Suri’s detention after it was first reported by Politico. In a post on X, McLaughlin called Suri a “foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.” McLaughlin added that Suri has “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.” Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, was formerly employed at Qatari-based news outlet Al Jazeera, and her father served as a political adviser to the “Prime Minister of Gaza” (the late Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, according to the New York Times) until 2010, according to a court declaration filed on March 20. A federal judge ruled on March 20 that the Trump Administration could not deport Suri while his case challenging his detention is being reviewed in court. Suri was held at the Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana before being transferred to the Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, which has also faced complaints about its conditions. Suri’s arrest and detention prompted protests on March 26 by Georgetown University students and academics calling for his release.

Momodou Taal Momodou Taal, a 31-year-old Cornell graduate student and dual U.K. and Gambian citizen, chose to leave the U.S. on March 31 after his student visa was revoked on March 14 and he faced the threat of detainment and deportation. Taal participated in pro-Palestinian protests last year, causing him to be suspended twice and at risk of losing his student visa. He also faced backlash after posting on X: “colonised peoples have the right to resist by any means necessary” after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. In a Nov. 2023 interview with CNN, Taal said, “I can say clearly categorically I abhor the killing of all civilians no matter where they are and who does it. I love life. I don’t love death. That’s what I am as a human being. Why is it the association because I’m a Muslim and I’m a Black person, I have to condemn a proscribed terrorist organization before having an opinion on genocide?” Taal was banned from campus for the remainder of the spring 2025 semester after protesting at a career fair attended by defense contractors.

Taal sought to preemptively block immigration enforcement against him by filing a lawsuit against the Trump Administration on March 15. The complaint, representing Taal and two other student activists, said the plaintiffs “fear government retaliation” for engaging in “constitutionally protected expression critical of U.S. foreign policy and supportive of Palestinian human rights.” Taal, a PhD student in Africana studies, was asked to surrender to ICE agents six days later. His attorneys, including Eric Lee, filed an emergency request blocking his detainment or deportation while the court reviews the constitutional challenge.

But after a judge denied a first motion to immediately block his deportation, Taal said in a March 31 post on X that he will voluntarily leave the U.S. “Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favourable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs. I have lost faith I could walk the streets without being abducted,” Taal wrote. “This is of course not the outcome I had wanted going into this, but we are facing a government that has no respect for the judiciary or for the rule of law.” Around 200 students and faculty protested on Cornell’s Ithaca campus earlier in March in support of Taal. “I wish I could be with you all in person, but the situation has got to the point where it is no longer safe,” Lee read from a statement by Taal at the start of the protest. “Momodou Taal is a test case to determine whether the government can come to your house, grab you and put you in jail for criticizing the United States government and its policies,” Lee said after a hearing on March 26.

Leqaa Kordia Leqaa Kordia was arrested in Newark, New Jersey, on March 14, according to a DHS statement, which said that the West Bank Palestinian had overstayed her student visa, which was terminated in January 2022 for “lack of attendance.” Kordia was among those arrested in April 2024 for her involvement in campus protests. As of March 31, she is being held at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, according to ICE records. Mahmoud Khalil Mahmoud Khalil was arrested at his home by ICE agents on March 8, 2025, and remains in custody as of March 31 at a Louisiana detention facility.

He was born in Syria to Palestinian refugees. Initially meant to study aviation engineering in Syria, he fled the country’s civil war to Beirut, Lebanon, and graduated from the Lebanese American University with a degree in computer science in 2018. He worked with several nonprofits in the Middle East, including Jusoor, a Syrian-American educational nonprofit, and the Syria Chevening Programme at the British Embassy in Beirut, which offers international scholarships to study in the U.K.—a role that former British diplomat Andrew Waller, and Khalil’s colleague at the time, said required an extensive background check. Khalil moved to the U.S. in 2022 to attend Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, completing his master’s degree studies in December 2024. He married an American woman—making him eligible for a green card—who is eight months pregnant with their first child. The 30-year-old was involved in several of the protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia University last spring, and he led negotiations between student protesters and university officials. Detractors say Khalil was a prominent leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a student group calling for Columbia to divest from its financial ties to Israel and which has been accused of antisemitism though the group rejects the label.

Last year, Khalil was suspended for one day from Columbia after police cracked down on students occupying a campus building. He told the BBC at the time that he was acting only as a protest negotiator and had not participated in the student encampment because he had been on a student visa. The university rescinded the suspension after finding they had no evidence against him. “It shows how random the suspension was,” he said at the time. “They did that randomly, and without due process.” The White House has alleged without evidence that Khalil distributed pro-Hamas materials at a protest and that he failed to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) on his green card application. The UNRWA, a U.N. agency that provides aid and relief to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, was banned by Israel last year for allegedly “spreading antisemitism” and having members who took part in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Khalil worked as an unpaid intern with UNRWA in 2023 but was never on staff, the agency told CNN.

A judge temporarily blocked the attempted deportation of Khalil on March 10, pending review of his case. Lawyers for Khalil also filed a lawsuit challenging his detention by ICE, and a New York judge ruled his case should be transferred to New Jersey instead of Louisiana, which the Trump Administration pushed for, as well as reaffirmed the previous ruling blocking his deportation. Khalil and seven other students filed a lawsuit against Columbia and the House Education and Workforce Committee on March 13 in an effort to prevent the disciplinary records of students—including around the student occupation of Hamilton Hall—from being turned over to the Republican-led committee. Read More: What To Know About Mahmoud Khalil, and Why His Green Card Was Revoked Ranjani Srinivasan Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old architect, came to the U.S. from Chennai, India, as a Fulbright recipient in 2016, became a PhD candidate at Columbia in 2020, and began teaching as an adjunct professor at New York University last fall. She was in the 5th year of her doctoral degree at Columbia University’s Department of Urban Planning when ICE agents knocked at her door on March 7.

Srinivasan learned that her student visa had been revoked by the Department of State via an email on March 5. She sought help from Columbia’s international students office and was told she was in legal status, according to a letter published on political scientist Norman Finkelstein’s website. But when three ICE agents came to her Columbia University apartment without a warrant two days later, she became worried, according to the New York Times. Her roommate, an American citizen, refused to let the agents in. Finding little recourse through the university’s hotlines, Srinivasan left for a safer location. On March 9, ICE terminated her SEVIS status and the university de-enrolled her, according to the letter. Facing the risk of detention and deportation, Srinivasan left the U.S. for Canada. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted on X airport surveillance footage showing Srinivasan at LaGuardia Airport in New York. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country,” Noem wrote in the post, adding that Srinivasan chose to “self deport.” Srinivasan’s lawyers denied the allegations against her, according to the Times.

In her letter posted to Finkelstein’s website, Srinivasan maintained that she only attended “a handful of low-level protests,” and, according to the Times, she signed several open letters related to the war in Gaza. She was arrested by police last year on the day that students occupied Hamilton Hall, but said she had only been walking through the crowd to return to her apartment. She received two summonses—for obstructing vehicular or pedestrian traffic and for refusing to disperse—but her case was dismissed, her lawyers told the Times.

“They’re making me out to be some sort of protest leader, which I’m not,” Srinivasan told Indian news site The News Minute. “I am just a PhD student who has too much work. Even if I wanted to go to a protest, I mostly don’t have time because I’m busy grading papers.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/students-trump-ice-detention.html,The Trump Administration Revoked 800 Student Visas. Here Is What To Know.,"Here is what we know about the students the Trump administration is seeking to deport.

Who is being targeted?

The affected students are, for the most part, in the United States with visas that allow foreign nationals to enter for full-time study. A handful have green cards, making them lawful permanent residents.

These students attend schools across the country, both private and public, including Arizona State University, the University of California and New York University.

While some students have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism, it appears a majority are not. Some of the visa revocations seem to be related to legal infractions in the students’ past.

“This is totally unprecedented,” said Fuji Whittenburg, an immigration lawyer in Calabasas, Calif., who is representing some of the students. She added, “A brush with law enforcement that didn’t necessarily result in an arrest or a conviction is all it took.”

Ms. Whittenburg said that one of her clients got a D.U.I. while studying in the United States more than a decade ago. When he applied for a second visa more recently, he disclosed the charge to U.S. consular authorities and was ultimately approved to pursue further studies."
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/international-students-revoked-visas-reasons-why-rcna200313,Why the Trump administration is revoking international student visas,"“It’s just part of their whole plan about reducing immigration entirely,” said Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney who runs a virtual law firm and represents several international students, most of them Asian. “They come after the small and the weak — people who don’t have as many resources to defend themselves.”

Students and schools say there is mass confusion about the reasons behind the revocations, the legality of the government’s actions and what options those without visas or status now have when it comes to getting their education.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Which student visas are at risk, and what do they do?

Most of the students who have been targeted are studying in the United States under the F-1 and J-1 visas. The F-1 visa allows noncitizens to enter the United States as full-time students at accredited education institutions. And to qualify for those visas, people must meet certain criteria, including approval from ICE, proficiency in English or enrollment in courses that lead to English proficiency and sufficient funds to support themselves during their entire courses of study.

The J-1 visa, available to students, teachers, researchers and other specialists, allows people to participate in approved programs for studying, conducting research, receiving training or demonstrating special skills. And after their programs are complete, they are required to return to their countries within 30 days.

Which schools are being affected?

The State Department began revoking visas last month, targeting foreign-born students at schools across the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that the State Department has revoked hundreds of students’ visas, taking aim at international students who participate in political activism.

“It might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” Rubio said at a news conference last month.

Those students have included Mahmoud Khalil, of Columbia University, a pro-Palestinian activist and green-card holder, whom ICE arrested and detained in early March, and Rümeysa Öztürk, of Tufts University, whom immigration officials apprehended on the street near the school a few weeks later.

Other cases fall outside the bounds of political protest, like that of Doğukan Günaydın, a Turkish student at the University of Minnesota, who was arrested in front of his home in St. Paul at the end of March because of a 2023 drunken driving conviction.

Shao said he has encountered many other cases of students in fields from materials engineering to epilepsy research. Some students were given vague reasons for the visa revocations, while others weren’t given any at all. Many schools said they were in the dark, as well.

Stanford, for example, said it found out about six visa revocations while it was doing a routine check of its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System database, which maintains information about nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors.

“It really feels like somebody wrote a computer program: ‘If arrested, then terminate,’” Shao said.

The State Department directed NBC News to comments spokesperson Tammy Bruce made Tuesday at a media briefing.

“We don’t discuss individual visas because of the privacy issues involved,” Bruce said. “What we can tell you is that the department revokes visas every day in order to secure our borders and to keep our community safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security recently created a task force that uses data analytic tools to scour international students’ social media histories for potential grounds to revoke their visas, three sources familiar with the operation previously told NBC News. They also said that the task force is searching for charges and criminal convictions on students’ records as well.

Why is the Trump administration targeting students?

The Trump administration hasn’t said publicly why such students are being singled out over others. But immigration attorneys and policy experts say it all goes back to the centerpiece of the Trump campaign: mass deportations. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said it is an example of the administration’s taking a “whole-of-government” approach to that immigration strategy.

“Here we’re seeing the Department of State working to cancel the visas of many students and those actions being done in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, which is the agency in charge of prosecuting these deportation cases in court,” Bush-Joseph said.

In the cases of Öztürk and other students who have been arrested in recent weeks, the Trump administration has cited a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens if the secretary determines their presence in the country would result in “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, said it’s also an effort by the government to send a “clear message about who is unwelcome in the United States,” especially since most students appear to be from nonwhite backgrounds.

“U.S. immigration policy seems to be driven by xenophobia, white nationalism and racism right now,” Mukherjee said.

What legal rights do students have?

Multiple students have sued the government because of the revocations.

The government maintains the right to revoke visas for various reasons, including DUI convictions or related offenses. They can also be revoked for national security purposes at the discretion of the State Department.

“Given the fact that the executive branch has such far-reaching discretion in many cases, it can be really difficult to determine what’s going on in specific cases,” Bush-Joseph said. “As a quick example of this, for a green card, someone can meet all of the requirements and still be denied just as a matter of discretion.”

Typically, Shao said, students are unable to appeal visa revocations. However, they can still reapply for visas. And they still have other rights, including the ability to stay in the country, as long as they don’t leave and try to re-enter.

However, many of the international students’ legal statuses were terminated, as well, making them potentially subject to detention and deportation, Shao said. But the government typically doesn’t have the right to remove legal status without actions such as crimes of violence or unauthorized work or dropping out of school.

“Getting your visa terminated is not automatically a reason to reject your status,” Shao said.

Still, many provisions of the Constitution protect all people, regardless of their status. And that means the students still have the right to defend themselves under due process and can’t be deported without it, Mukherjee said. The Supreme Court affirmed that Monday in its ruling on the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, she said. The court ruled that people have the right to challenge the use of the act and should be given time to challenge their detentions before they are taken out of the country.

“These are some basic principles of law, basic principles underlying the Constitution, and should be respected by all three branches of government,” she said. “We are at the brink of a breakdown in the rule of law and the immigration space.”

Often, other forms of immigration relief are available to international students, including humanitarian relief.

And while some students have received messages from the State Department urging them to self-deport, Mukherjee said they don’t necessarily have to listen. Instead, she advises them to seek legal support.

“Simply because the notice says you have to depart the United States immediately or you need to depart from the United States within five days, that doesn’t make it lawful or true or correct or accurate,” Mukherjee said.

Shao also said schools should step in to provide support.

“You accepted these kids to come,” Shao said. “The school should try to help the kids as much as they can.”"

Protesters march as they rally for Gaza and demand the release of detained Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, March 18, 2025, in New York City.

President Donald Trump's administration has set off a legal and ethical firestorm by targeting international students at United States colleges for deportation, including some who the government alleges participated in protests or activities on campuses in support of Palestine.

The administration has claimed, without presenting evidence, that some of those students supported the terrorist organization Hamas, while the students say the White House is treading on their constitutional right to free speech and the longstanding tradition of participating in campus demonstrations.

Since Trump's Jan. 30 executive order to ""combat the explosion of anti-Semitism on our campuses and streets"" in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the State Department has revoked around 300 visas so far, many of them held by college students alleged to have participated in activities advocating for Palestine and its people on the nation's campuses, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

""If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us the reason you are coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus – we're not going to give you a visa,"" Rubio said, adding, ""Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.""

Here's what we know and don't know about some of the more high-profile cases involving foreign students who have had their visas revoked, who have been detained or who have self-deported after being targeted by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Mahmoud Khalil

Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old Columbia University international affairs graduate student of Palestinian descent, was arrested on March 8 when ICE agents appeared at his student apartment building, despite him being a legal permanent U.S. resident in possession of a green card. Khalil is married to an American citizen, who is pregnant with their first child.

The Trump administration accused Khalil, a Palestinian activist, of supporting Hamas and distributing ""pro-Hamas propaganda,"" though it has provided no evidence to support that claim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed on March 11 that Khalil distributed ""pro-Hamas propaganda fliers with the logo of Hamas,"" but declined to provide details.

Ramzi Kassem, the director of CLEAR, a group representing Khalil, called Leavitt's claim ""nonsense"" and said there is ""no truth to it whatsoever.""

During a pro-Palestinian student protest at Columbia University last spring, Khalil served as a negotiator when students bargained with school officials over a tent encampment they established on campus. During the days-long demonstration, some protestors also occupied the school's Hamilton Hall and defied orders to disperse, prompting the university to write a letter formally allowing the New York Police Department to enter the campus and break up the protest, during which time they made dozens of arrests. Khalil was not among those arrested, according to the NYPD, who confirmed to ABC News that ""there are no arrests on file"" for Khalil.

""His one and only goal was to get Columbia University to divest from its complicity with Israeli government crimes in Gaza and the West Bank,"" Kassem said of Khalil's involvement in the protests.

Khalil is being held at an ICE detention facility in Louisiana and has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government's attempt to deport him. He has not been charged with a crime, although the government alleges he intentionally misrepresented information on his green card application and therefore is inadmissible to the United States.

According to recent court filings, the Trump administration said Khalil failed to disclose when applying for his green card last year that his employment by the Syria Office at the British Embassy in Beirut went ""beyond 2022"" and that he was a ""political affairs officer"" for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNWRA) from June to November 2023.

In arresting Khalil, the government invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that they said allows the secretary of state to revoke the legal status of people whose presence in the country could have ""adverse foreign policy consequences.""

In a letter he released from the detention facility in which he's being held, Khalil described himself as a ""political prisoner.""

""My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night,"" Khalil wrote in the March 18 letter, referring to the renewed attacks on Gaza after the collapse of the ceasefire.

A federal judge in New Jersey on April 2 retained Khalil's case, rejecting the government’s request to move it to Louisiana or dismiss it altogether. The opinion, unless appealed by the government, would clear the way for the judge to decide the more substantive issues of Khalil's continued confinement.

Khalil is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge for a removal hearing on April 8.

Ranjani Srinivasan

An urban planning doctoral student at Columbia University, Ranjani Srinivasan, a citizen of India who was in the country on an F-1 student visa, used the U.S. Customs and Border Protection home app to self-deport on March 11, according to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem.

""Srinivasan was involved in activities supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization,"" Noem said in a March 14 statement, which did not include evidence to support the allegation against Srinivasan.

""I am not a terrorist sympathizer so I just kind of find it absurd,"" Srinivasan said during a CBC interview March 19. ""I'm a Ph.D. student … who actually rarely left the office because I was busy working or grading my students' papers.""

In a March 22 statement, the group Student Workers of Columbia – of which Srinivasan is a member, the union confirmed in response to an ABC News request for comment – said Srinivasan was notified on March 6 that her student visa had been revoked and that on March 8, ICE agents went to her Columbia housing apartment seeking entry, allegedly without a warrant, but did not arrest or detain anyone. Srinivasan was subsequently informed by the university's International Students and Scholars Office that she was being disenrolled by the university and ordered to vacate her student housing, according to the Student Workers of Columbia statement.

""With no housing or visa and a continued stream of threats from ICE to detain her, Ranjani made the difficult decision to leave the country for Canada,"" according to the statement.

Srinivasan has not been charged with a crime. The Student Workers of Columbia has been circulating a petition asking Columbia to re-enroll Srinivasan and for the government to reinstate her visa.

Leqaa Kordia

A Palestinian from the West Bank, Leqaa Kordia was arrested on March 13 by the Department of Homeland Security.

According to DHS, Kordia was arrested for allegedly overstaying her expired visa, which the agency said terminated on Jan. 26, 2022.

In a March 14 statement, DHS said that Kordia's student visa was terminated for lack of class attendance. She was previously arrested in April 2024 for her alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, according to the DHS statement.

“Columbia has no record of this individual being registered as a current or former student at the University,"" a spokesperson for the university said in response to an ABC News request for comment.

""It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,"" DHS Secretary Noem said in a statement following Kordia's arrest.

Multiple attempts to determine the current status of Kordia's case and whether she is currently being detained, including repeated ABC News inquiries to ICE and DHS, were not immediately successful.

Yunseo Chung

Yunseo Chung, a junior at Columbia University, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after ICE agents went to her residence on March 13 looking for her, one day after an ICE official signed an administrative arrest warrant for her, according to her lawsuit.

According to her lawsuit, Chung was born in South Korea but is a lawful permanent U.S. resident who has lived in the United States since she was 7 years old.

""This action challenges the government's shocking overreach in seeking to deport a college student, Plaintiff-Petitioner Yunseo Chung, who is a lawful permanent resident of this country, because of her protected free speech,"" according to Chung's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ""The government's actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny.""

The lawsuit contends, ""Simply put, immigration enforcement – here, immigration detention and threatened deportation – may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration.""

According to her lawsuit, Chung has participated since 2023 in student protests on the Columbia campus related to Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip. On March 5, Chung was among a group of students arrested by the New York Police Department for holding a sit-in at an academic building at Barnard College, according to her lawsuit. She was given a desk appearance ticket accusing her of obstruction of governmental administration, her lawsuit claims.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a March 25 statement that Chung had engaged in ""concerning conduct"" and cited her prior arrest during a protest at Barnard College, which DHS described as a ""pro-Hamas"" protest.

""ICE HSI will investigate individuals engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization,"" the DHS statement said.

""Ms. Chung has felt moved to join efforts to advocate for Palestinian human rights,"" the lawsuit states, under a heading titled Ms. Chung’s Exercise of Free Speech Rights in Support of Palestinians.

""Ms. Chung has also felt compelled to criticize Columbia for its handling of student protests supporting Palestinian human rights, including the punitive measures imposed on certain students,"" according to the lawsuit.

Chung's lawsuit also states that some opponents of pro-Palestinian protest activities ""frequently mischaracterize"" them as ""inherently supportive of Hamas or terrorism and anti-Semitic.""

A federal judge in New York issued a temporary restraining order on March 25 blocking federal agents from detaining Chung.

Rumeysa Ozturk

A Ph.D. student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national with a valid F-1 visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 near her home in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts.

In a statement to ABC News, a DHS spokesperson said: ""Rumeysa Ozturk is a Turkish national and Tufts University graduate student, granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa. DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans."" The DHS statement did not specify the activities in which Ozturk is alleged to have participated.

""A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated,"" the DHS statement further said.

On March 26, 2024, Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar, was one of four Tufts students who wrote an op-ed published in the school student newspaper, The Tufts Daily, asking the university to agree to resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Senate to divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.

""Credible accusations against Israel include accounts of deliberate starvation and indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinian civilians and plausible genocide,"" the op-ed said, in part. It's unknown whether the editorial played a part in Ozturk's arrest.

""Rumeysa has not been accused of committing any crime. It appears the only thing she is being targeted for is her right to free speech,"" Mahsa Khanbabai, an attorney representing Ozturk, said in a statement provided to ABC News.

A statement in support of Ozturk, dated April 1 and signed by Tufts President Sunil Kumar, acknowledges the March 26 editorial, and further states that the university ""has no information to support the allegations that [Ozturk] was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention,"" and that it ""has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the University's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.""

Ozturk is currently listed in the ICE database as ""in custody"" and appears to be held at an ICE processing center in Basile, Louisiana.

On March 25, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Ozturk cannot be deported until the judge determines whether the court has jurisdiction to decide whether Ozturk was lawfully taken into custody.

Judge Denise Casper said in her ruling that Ozturk ""shall not be removed from the United States until further Order by this Court.""

Following an April 3 hearing, Judge Casper did not issue a ruling and said she will first decide whether she has jurisdiction before other motions in the lawsuit can be considered.

Alireza Doroudi

Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian citizen and a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama, was arrested at his home on March 25.

The Department of Homeland Security said Doroudi’s student visa was revoked and he was subsequently arrested because he ""posed significant national security concerns.""

But Doroudi's attorney, David Rozas, told ABC News that he has ""not been informed of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.""

Rozas said Doroudi has ""not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests.""

Alireza Doroudi is shown in this undated photo. LinkedIn

Doroudi was initially held in a county jail in Alabama but has since been transferred to ICE's Jena-LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana, according to the ICE website.

""He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering,"" Rozas said. ""He is also in the early stages of applying for an EB-1/Adjustment of Status as a researcher with extraordinary ability.""

Rozas said Doroudi is studying at the University of Alabama on active I-20/SEVIS status, referring to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.

Momodou Taal

A Ph.D. student of Africana studies at Cornell University, Momodou Taal filed a federal lawsuit on March 15 seeking to block the enforcement of Trump executive orders that he feared could lead to his deportation.

But six days after filing the lawsuit, the 31-year-old citizen of the U.K. and Gambia was asked to voluntarily surrender to ICE agents, according to his attorneys.

In its court filing, the Department of Justice said Taal's student visa was revoked before he filed his lawsuit but ICE agents had trouble locating him. The revocation is based on Taal's alleged involvement in “disruptive protests,” disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, the government said.

According to court records, Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell for a second time last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has limited access to the upstate New York campus as he continues his studies remotely, according to his attorneys.

""If the First Amendment does not protect the right to attend a demonstration, what's left? Not much,"" said Taal's attorney, Eric Lee.

On March 27, a federal judge denied Taal's bid to prevent his deportation and his challenge of two Trump executive orders that have been used to target other pro-Palestinian students.

Taal announced on Monday that he has exited the United States and is ""safe"" in an undisclosed country.

""Today I took the decision to leave the United States, free and with my head held high,"" Taal said in a social media post.

While his lawyers planned to make another legal argument for a temporary restraining order, Taal wrote in his post: ""Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favorable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs.""

""I have lost faith I could walk the streets without being abducted. Weighing up these options, I took the decision to leave on my own terms,"" Taal's post continued. ""This is of course not the outcome I had wanted going into this, but we are facing a government that has no respect for the judiciary or for the rule of law.""

Badar Khan Suri

A visiting scholar from India and a researcher at Georgetown University, Badar Khan Suri was detained on March 17 outside his Washington, D.C.- area apartment.

The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Suri was ""actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media."" The department also alleged he had close connections to a ""known or suspected terrorist"" who is a senior adviser to Hamas.

Suri, who is married to Mapheze Saleh, a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent, was sent to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, according to his attorney.

Badar Khan Suri Georgetown University

A lawsuit filed by Suri's attorneys said the Trump administration appeared to be targeting the Georgetown University fellow due to his wife's identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech.

""This was done pursuant to a policy to retaliate against and punish noncitizens like Mr. Suri solely for their family ties to those who may have either expressed criticism of U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Israel,"" attorneys representing Suri said in a complaint.

In a sworn declaration filed March 20 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Mapheze Saleh said that following the Oct. 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, she ""shared posts on a daily basis"" about subsequent events in Gaza, ""including posts that expressed sorrow for the deaths of Gazan people."" Because of this, Saleh said, and because her father previously served in the government of Gaza until 2010, ""multiple articles were published about me and my family, and eventually about my husband. A website claimed falsely that my husband and I have 'ties to Hamas.'""

Nermeen Arastu, one of Suri's attorneys, told ABC News that Suri's detainment happened because ""President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.""

Suri has not been accused of a crime, his lawyers said.

Georgetown University said Suri was granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.

https://thepienews.com/applyboard-launches-new-ai-feature-for-student-applications/,ApplyBoard launches new AI feature for student applications,"The feature, launched at ApplyBoard’s Top Recruiters Workshop 2025 in Delhi last week, aims to enable recruitment partners to submit student applications more quickly and reliably.

“Once you choose your program and you submit your initial application, in a traditional world, you would have needed to give your documents in and wait for schools, maybe multiple back and forths and weeks to get that feedback and eventually get that offer,” Massi Basiri, co-founder and president of ApplyBoard told The PIE News.

“In our world, where we’ve rolled out Instant Submission, the moment you upload the corresponding document, you instantly get feedback. This feedback can range from the quality of the document to what’s missing, all the way to whether the document meets what the school is looking for.”

With tools like 360 Solutions, which go beyond just the application process, and ApplyProof, a document verification service, ApplyBoard has been developing its approach to how international student enrollments are handled.

More recently, the platform introduced Capio, which is designed as an “end-to-end” system aimed at helping universities manage international student enrollment more efficiently.

According to Sina Meraji, senior director of product development, ApplyBoard, the launch of Instant Submission is built on new technology shaped by years of collaboration with partners and the development of various related products.

“A big portion of the technology is basically the LLM models and machine learning models that we have. And those are the latest – we literally compared the performance of the latest models from different partners we work with and based on the performance have accelerated our updates,” stated Meraji.

The feature is particularly relevant in a market like India – one of ApplyBoard’s largest – where the number of students going abroad has surged significantly over the past decade.

“The level of service expectation once it comes to speed I have never seen in any other market,” stated Basiri.

“So I think it’s bang on for India because they do things with the speed of light and expect things with the speed of light. I don’t think it would have been any better received in any other market than India.”

The reality is that in digital worlds, you can catch fraud or inconsistencies a lot easier

Massi Basiri, ApplyBoard

While the platform helps ApplyBoard’s recruitment partners submit student applications and receive feedback seamlessly, fraudulent applications could pose a significant concern for institutions.

“Fraud becomes a critical point of view from schools because, often, it’s perceived that in a digital world, it’s easier to tamper. But the reality is that in digital worlds, you can catch fraud or inconsistencies a lot easier. Things are sometimes not even detectable with the human eye,” said Basiri.

“There are certain documents that are verifiable, like English scores. In those cases, we check against the source to ensure that the document is authentic. What’s presented on the document is matched against the back-end system of those providers.”

According to Basiri, not all documents come with that capability, so they look into other platforms, like Digilocker in India, to verify documents.

“In the absence of any other source, we use other models, AIs, and tools to look for irregularities and inconsistencies,” he added.

With ApplyBoard’s “Instant Offer” assuring offers to students once they receive feedback on their applications from institutions, Basiri addressed how the organisation can assist students if they don’t hear back from their chosen institution.

“We have multiple sets of schools, those open-minded schools that are more futuristic. They know how technology can accelerate. We work with those close partners and integrate at a greater lens systematically so we can issue those offers on their behalf,” stated Basiri.

“Apart from that, in our system now, we have other AI technology that would actually enable and help the student with things that are not common or things that they’re not familiar with. For example, we have an SOP guide we just launched, which they can use to make it easier for them to understand and create a draft.”

According to Hamed Karimian, senior product manager, ApplyBoard, the platform is looking to improve students’ chances of success by helping filter schools based on their likelihood of acceptance, while also making adjustments to the quality of documents and other application materials.

“First, we filter and sift through the schools where the student has the highest chance and then we help them to write a better SOP, make adjustments to their resume, and make sure that all the documents provided by them are in good quality, giving them a strong chance,” shared Karimian.

“Once we do all of these adjustments with the student, and help submit the application to the school, we have a 95.7% success rate for getting an admission from the schools.”"
https://www.justsecurity.org/109069/u-s-ai-driven-catch-and-revoke-initiative-threatens-first-amendment-rights/,U.S. AI-Driven “Catch and Revoke” Initiative Threatens First Amendment Rights,"On March 8, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on the university’s campus. They claimed that Khalil’s student visa had both been revoked and when told that he had a green card, said that too had been revoked. While the full facts of the case are yet to emerge, there seems little doubt that Khalil was detained in retaliation for his activism. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently and explicitly threatened to go after university protestors, including in his Executive Order on “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,” which I analyzed in an earlier post. Trump celebrated Khalil’s arrest on social media, warning that it was the first “of many to come.”

Some of the “many to come” will likely be identified via the State Department’s newly launched AI-enabled “Catch and Revoke” initiative, which will scrape social media to find “foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups” and cancel their visas. Like the executive order cited above, this effort is framed as an anti-terrorism measure. Instead, it is being used to terrorize foreigners and to dissuade people from participating in First Amendment-protected activity for fear that they too will be targeted in some way.

Starting with the Obama administration, the federal government has built an extensive infrastructure for agencies to comb social media looking for certain types of speech. Even as civil society groups have raised concerns about how these programs could be used to target unpopular speech, they have continued to proliferate.

The State Department, for example, collects social media handles from certain types of visa applicants — some 14 million people a year — which are saved indefinitely in government databases. (The Brennan Center, where I work, and the Knight Institute have challenged this program in court.) The second Trump administration is aiming to dramatically expand these efforts, collecting social media identifiers from an additional 33 million people, including those applying for permanent residence or adjustment of their immigration status. The first Trump administration’s attempt to do so was blocked in 2021 by the Biden White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on the grounds that the government had not demonstrated “the practical utility of collecting this information.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) runs at least 12 overlapping programs that track what Americans say online, several of which are focused on protests. DHS used social media to track protests against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies. During the Biden administration, DHS scanned social media for other targets, such as Americans discussing abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and trucker convoys protesting Covid-19 mandates, as well as broadly monitoring online “narratives and grievances” —i.e., people talking politics.

Even as it adds more and more social media monitoring programs to its repertoire, the government has never shown that these efforts are effective. A February 2017 DHS Inspector General audit of six pilot programs found that the department had not even measured their effectiveness. And the few government evaluations that are publicly available undermine any governmental claims of efficacy. A brief prepared by DHS for the first Trump administration concluded that social media monitoring did not provide useful information for vetting refugees. And, according to a 2021 analysis by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, social media identifiers added “no value” to the immigration screening and vetting process.

Looking for unknown foreign protestors who may have made ostensibly pro-terrorist statements is much harder than vetting the posts of a known person, such as a visa applicant. It will undoubtedly sweep far too broadly and result in mistakes. The AI tools that will be deployed by the State Department likely will be tasked to search for specific words or phrases. The Trump administration has used these types of lists in its attempt to root out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the federal government, resulting in various blunders. In one instance, a federal employee who managed relations with private equity-held businesses was placed on administrative leave “pursuant to the President’s executive order on DEIA.” The Internal Revenue Service purged its employee manual of references to the “inequity” of holding on to taxpayer money longer than necessary and the “inclusion” of a taxpayer identification number on a form. The Defense Department flagged for deletion mentions of the World War II Enola Gay aircraft and references to people who have the last name “Gay.”

Even without mistakes, broad social media monitoring will have enormous First Amendment consequences. The types of speech that the administration has declared it intends to target is exceptionally broad. In defending his arrest, DHS said Khalil led activities “aligned” with Hamas, a term untethered to any law or regulation. Statements from Trump and his cabinet characterize foreigners who are in the administration’s crosshairs as “pro-Hamas” (most common), “pro-terrorist,” “terrorist sympathizers,” people who “support terrorism,” and “anti-Semitic.” These are broad and contested terms. Pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel sentiments have often been conflated with anti-Semitism or pro-terrorism, leaving a broad swath of people vulnerable to being caught in an AI-enabled social media net.

The Trump administration’s efforts ultimately may sweep even more broadly, seeking out speech that it views as anti-American. The vetting executive order instructed the Secretary of State to recommend measures for foreign nationals who call for the “overthrow or replacement of the culture on which our constitutional Republic stands.” In addition, the sole justification provided by the administration for acting against Khalil is a single line in the Notice to Appear in immigration court: “The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse policy consequences for the foreign policy of the United States,” citing 237(A)(4)(c)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” As Adam Cox and Ahilan Arulanantham explained on Just Security, this provision cannot be read as a blank check for the administration to deport people based on an unarticulated foreign policy rationale. But if the administration wants to deport foreigners who take positions contrary to U.S. foreign policy, they will certainly find plenty of fodder on social media.

Khalil’s case and the Trump administration’s promise to go after foreign protestors for their social media posts is an extraordinary assertion of executive power over immigrants living in the United States. But it should not be viewed in isolation. It is part of Trump’s broader effort to subdue all potential sources of opposition by attacking universities, the press, law firms, and jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with ICE. All of these endanger the fundamental constitutional promise of a democratic society in which a multitude of views and interests can be freely expressed.

https://sahanjournal.com/education/international-students-data-collection-ice-arrests/,How the government collects and uses data on international students,"The recent arrests of two international students in Minnesota and stripping of legal student status from five others have raised widespread alarm and questions about the legality of such actions across the country.

Part of the federal strategy is not new. Immigration authorities require schools to share information about their international students, and have legally monitored students’ social media accounts for several years, Minnesota immigration attorneys say. But arresting them or ordering them to self-deport based on their political views and presence at protests steps into unclear legal territory, they say.

While some international students have been arrested in other states for political activism, the March 27 arrest of a University of Minnesota student was likely linked to a drunken driving conviction and not political speech, the student’s attorney wrote in a lawsuit filed against government officials.

It’s unknown why an international student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, was arrested on March 28, or why five other international students at the school had their legal student status revoked.

Here’s how the federal monitoring system works: When an international student obtains a visa to study in the United States, their personal information is logged into a federal database. In 2019, applications for international student visas began asking students to include information about their social media accounts.

Immigration authorities “have the whole international student database at their fingertips,” said Craig Peterson, an immigration attorney.

Another database, called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), keeps track of international students. Schools with international students are required to log their names, addresses, email addresses, country of citizenship and the number of classes they’re taking.

Schools are also asked to report passport numbers, the airport students arrive at and their dates of entry into the United States.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can check the database to learn about an international student’s visa status, said Ana Pottratz Acosta, an immigration attorney who teaches at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul.

“The difference here is that their social media monitoring appears to be checks of social media for political speech that has historically been protected by the First Amendment,” she said.

An international student’s status can be terminated on SEVIS for a variety of reasons, including expulsion from school, not being enrolled as a full-time student or unauthorized work, said Minnetonka immigration attorney Steven Thal.

A student’s status on SEVIS is different from their visa, Pottratz Acosta said. A student visa allows an international student to enter the United States, but once they arrive, it is their student status, rather than their visa, that determines whether they can stay lawfully.

Schools don’t report students’ criminal charges or convictions to ICE, Peterson said. However, the federal government reviews criminal data available through the court system, and cross references it with information on international students in SEVIS.

If an international student commits a crime that is considered a removable offense under immigration law, their visa can be revoked and they can be deported, Pottratz Acosta said. If that occurs, school officials do not automatically cancel a student’s status on SEVIS. But it’s possible that an international student can have their visa revoked and SEVIS status terminated at the same time.

When a student’s status is terminated on SEVIS, they are expected to either request reinstatement or immediately leave the country, according to Study in the States, a DHS website.

Minnesota arrests

Doğukan Günaydın, the University of Minnesota student from Turkey arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week, did not participate in protests or write any political articles, according to his lawsuit. He is asking a federal judge for release from custody and reinstatement of his student status.

When he was arrested, his lawsuit states, his student status on SEVIS was still active. But seven hours after his arrest, a DHS official terminated that status, thereby removing his ability to stay in the United States.

Günaydın was apparently targeted because of a June 2023 arrest in Minneapolis for driving with a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit of .08. He pleaded guilty, according to his lawsuit.

“What the lawsuit is going to have to be about is whether ICE can, on the basis of a DUI, cancel your SEVIS record and thereby destroy your legal status in the United States and render you removable,” Peterson said.

The Mankato student who was arrested last week had a valid student visa at the time, according to a statement from Students United, an advocacy nonprofit representing seven state universities. Their identity has not been publicly released.

‘Atmosphere of fear’

Some recent arrests of international students, including at Columbia University in New York City and Tufts University in Massachusetts, were in response to their online political views and presence at protests, especially those related to the war in Gaza.

In those cases, ICE officials could have used photos from protests, social media posts and bylined opinion articles as evidence that the government claims could lead to deportation, Peterson said.

Judges will have to decide whether those arrests violated the students’ First Amendment rights, immigration attorneys say.

“We do see the current administration really trying to ignore those [constitutional rights] and rush through their enforcement processes before the courts have an opportunity to react,” Peterson said.

He recommends that international students carry their passport on them at all times, or their I-20, a document that certifies their admission to a school and enables them to have a visa.

Some universities are advising international students who are currently in countries listed under a proposed travel ban to return to the United States, according to NAFSA, a nonprofit dedicated to international education. They’re also recommending that students refrain from traveling to those countries.

More than 40 countries, including Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela, are listed in the proposed travel ban, according to the New York Times.

“A lot of things are happening very rapidly, and it seems as though the goal is to create an atmosphere of fear by a lot of people so that it will silence any action or political speech that is viewed negatively by the Trump administration,” Pottratz Acosta said. “I think that is a bigger problem than simply looking at targeted actions against international students. It has far greater implications.”

If approached by an ICE agent, an international student has the right to remain silent, Thal said. International students can also apply for other visas if they are eligible and their current visa is revoked, he added.

Students United also recommends that international students check their visas frequently and stay updated on changes with their country of origin and the United States."

BBC

For the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres. Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a ""privilege"" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons. But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector. For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students. The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC. ""I could be next,"" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza. He's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement. Another student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries. And at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US. Most students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target. The BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.

His detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana. Last Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa. ""Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,"" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri. The White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that ""run counter"" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy. In a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the ""ringleader of chaos"" at the university.

Polling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating. Universities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to ""surrendering its independence"". Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?

Georgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is ""silencing dissent"" by intimidating would-be protesters. The Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.

In addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest. ""I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,"" he said. Georgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi. ""This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,"" he said. At Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.

https://www.nafsa.org/reports-of-actions-targeting-international-students,NAFSA Releases Initial Analysis of Visa Revocations and other Actions Targeting International Students and Scholars,"For Immediate Release

Washington – Since mid-March, NAFSA: Association of International Educators has been collecting reports of international students and scholars having their visas revoked, their record terminated in SEVIS, and/or being arrested and detained. Based on its initial analysis of these reports, extensive conversations with its members, and consultation with immigration attorneys, NAFSA is able to provide some preliminary information about the size, scale, and nature of the enforcement actions affecting international students and scholars in the United States.

As of April 10, there have been more than 800 reports of international students and scholars either having their visa revoked and/or their record in SEVIS terminated. This tally will be updated on an ongoing basis.

Undergraduate, graduate, and Optional Practical Training (OPT)/STEM OPT students are affected.

There is no clear pattern or trend in terms of nationality of student. Students from all regions of the world are being impacted.

The visa revocations and SEVIS record terminations are happening to students at all types of higher education institutions, from community colleges to R-1 research institutions and in all regions of the United States.

The cause given for the SEVIS record terminations has changed. The termination reason used when NAFSA first became aware of the terminations was ""Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status"" with notations to specific Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) provisions as the basis for the record terminations. Some terminations referenced an INA provision related to ""potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences."" Others cited a ""criminal records check"" and a general INA provision related to failure to maintain status or comply with conditions of status. Now the termination reasons have been changed to “Other” with a vague reference to a criminal records check ""and/or"" a visa revocation, but no citations to the INA.

There is still no transparency into the grounds for these revocations, nor is there any clear process for determining what the charges are against the student. Due process is woefully absent.

The potential ramifications of these enforcements are significant. As Fanta Aw, Executive Director and CEO of NAFSA: Association of International Educators said in a press release issued by the U.S. for Success Coalition, “International students fuel American innovation, foster cultural exchange, and enhance our national security by deepening global understanding. It is in our national interest to ensure they can continue contributing to our nation’s prosperity and security. International students are the most tracked and vetted visitors to this country. Deterring them from choosing the United States will not make us safer but will certainly deprive us of global talent at a time when competition for these students is increasing around the world.”

The U.S. for Success Coalition, of which NAFSA is a founding member, is calling on Congress to press the administration to avoid immigration actions and travel restrictions that jeopardize America’s global strength in attracting the world’s best and brightest to U.S. colleges and universities. New survey results show that interest in U.S. postgraduate education has plunged 40 percent since January 2025 while there is rising interest in Germany, France, and China as a study destination.

The Coalition invites students and leaders from all sectors—including higher education, foreign policy, and business—to reach out to their members of Congress with the message that the administration should make it a national priority to welcome international students and scholars to study and succeed here.

NAFSA will continue to closely monitor the situation and actively gather information to better understand the scope and circumstances of these actions. As NAFSA members seek to comply with visa and immigration laws and policies, NAFSA’s priority remains advocating for policies and practices that ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of all international students and scholars. We will engage with relevant authorities and partners to seek clarity and support a transparent process.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/how-many-student-visas-revoked,"US government has revoked more than 600 student visas, data shows","More than 600 international students and recent graduates in the US have had their visas revoked or their legal status changed by the state department, according to data aggregated from around the country.

The data, collected by Inside Higher Ed, shows that as of Thursday more than 100 colleges and universities have identified more than 600 cases of students whose immigration status was changed by the Trump administration. These institutions say that their students have lost their F-1 or J-1 student visas.

Some of these cases were related to their activism and participation in student-led protests against the war in Gaza, and others were for “minor crimes”. Inside Higher Ed says that the majority of college officials say they’re unsure why the foreign-born students had their visas revoked or have yet to receive formal notification of the changes. Most have still not received any communications from immigration authorities.

The compiled data set was based on public reports and direct correspondence, Inside Higher Ed says. The database, first published 8 April, will be consistently updated at least twice a day.

Late last month, it was reported that the state department had revoked 300 or more student visas in the three weeks that its “Catch and Revoke” program was in operation.

The initiative, newly launched by the state department, which says it is at least partly powered by artificial intelligence (AI), scrapes social media to find “foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups” and cancel their visas, according to reporting from Axios.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, confirmed the scale of the March crackdown and referred to the student activists as “lunatics”. He told reporters during a visit to Guyana in South America when asked about the visa terminations: “Maybe more than 300 at this point” have lost their visas. “We do it every day, every time I find one of these lunatics.”

It was increasingly clear that the abrupt visa cancellations are not limited to students who engage in pro-Palestinian activism. Students with minor non-criminal infractions, such as speeding tickets, were also targeted.

The Guardian previously reported on an online data sheet created and updated by affected students that showed students from 50 universities reporting their visas were canceled around 4 April , with some tracing the cause to police citations or non-criminal offenses.

Students at the University of Florida have planned a campus protest in support of Felipe Zapata Velázquez, 27, a Colombian student deported by the Trump administration following his arrest for alleged traffic violations.

His family said he was “undergoing a physical and emotional recovery process” in his home country after police arrested him on 28 March for offenses that included having an expired tag and suspended driver’s license, before turning him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

The Florida Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost accused authorities of “kidnapping” Velázquez, who held an F-1 student visa. “Felipe Zapata Velázquez is just the latest victim of Trump’s disgusting campaign against immigrants,” Frost said in a statement.

Two other cases which received widespread attention were those of Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate who led pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus last summer, and Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University who was arrested in apparent retaliation for an op-ed she wrote that was critical of Israel. Both are in Ice detention fighting their deportations on the grounds that their actions constituted free speech under the first amendment."
https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/05/03/how-many-international-students-visas-revoked/83216625007/,How many international students had their legal status changed? Maps show Trump's impact.,"After thousands of international students had their visas revoked in April, the Trump administration reversed course, saying it is restoring the student visa registrations of potentially thousands of foreign students in the United States. The Justice Department announced the decision in a filing April 25 in U.S. district court in Massachusetts, where a lawsuit had been filed in response to the terminations.

Data from Inside Higher Ed shows at least 280 colleges and universities reported more than 1,800 international students and recent graduates had their legal status altered by the State Department.

Universities reported some students being forced to leave the United States immediately, in many cases after discovering their visas were canceled in the federal Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS) or via an unexpected text or email.

Universities and the government use the database to track foreign students, and students rely on it for their authorization to remain in the country. The terminations sparked more than 100 lawsuits. NAFSA, the Association of International Educators, has tallied roughly 1,400 revocations.

Erasing records from SEVIS is different from revoking visas, USA TODAY has reported. These records allow international students to stay in the United States legally and attend classes.

As of the 2023-2024 school year, an estimated 1.1 million international students study in the United States. USA TODAY reporters looked at which universities host the most international students and where the concentration of student visas were revoked.

Which states revoked student visas?

A database tracking total student visa terminations found that more than 1,800 international students and recent graduates had their legal status changed. The data is based on public reports and direct correspondence compiled by Inside Higher Ed. The number could be even higher − the database notes that several universities did not indicate the amount of visas that had been revoked.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in April that he revoked at least 300 visas from students. And at Colorado State University, officials said six students there lost their visas. It was unclear whether the students have the right to appeal their visa revocations, USA TODAY reported in April.

Which universities had the most student visas revoked?

Reported cases of student visa terminations are shown in the map below. A number with an asterisk indicates a positive change in the count, such as a visa reinstatement, according to the author of the database.

The California State University system reported a total 70 student visas revoked, and the University of Texas system reported 170, according to Inside Higher Ed.

Immigration experts said they've never seen the federal government make such sweeping changes to the ordinarily low-profile process of hosting international students. The National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations, which have affected students in California, Colorado, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts and Florida, among others.

How many international students are in the U.S.?

According to the federal government, California is home to the largest number of international students, and the most popular majors among international students are computer science, language, and business administration and management.

People from India and China represent the largest proportion of international students, accounting for about half of the overall enrollment, according to federal officials.

New York University has the largest concentration of international students with 22% of its student body from foreign countries, an Open Doors report shows. Northeastern University in Boston follows with the largest international student body population.

The students are being provided academic support and encouraged to seek legal counsel.

Hundreds of international students across the U.S. have had their visas revoked recently.

Six international students connected to Missouri State University are among the hundreds studying in the U.S. whose student visas were recently revoked by the Trump administration.

The university learned of the revocation last week, said Brad Bodenhausen, vice president for community and global partnerships.

""Neither the university nor the students were notified directly of this status change,"" he wrote, in a statement. ""Upon becoming aware of the action, MSU notified the impacted students.""

Bodenhausen said three current students and three postgraduate students at Missouri State had their Student Exchange Visitor Information System records and F-1 student statuses terminated by the Department of Homeland Security.

Of the three current students, one is an undergraduate and two are graduate students.

""We are providing academic support to these students and encouraging them to seek legal counsel,"" he said, in the statement.

The university has not disclosed the countries of origin for the six students.

It was not clear how quickly the students were expected to leave the country.

International students at some universities have been forced to leave immediately, according to reporting last week from USA Today.

The visa cancellations have been challenged by the National Immigration Project. More than a dozen higher education groups including the American Council on Education have requested a briefing from federal officials.

At this point, there is no clearinghouse reporting the exact number of revocations but the visa cancellations appear to have impacted a small percentage of the estimated 1.5 million international students who have been granted permission to study in the U.S.

In recent years, Missouri State has had an average of 1,500 international students. Fall enrollment numbers for the 2024-25 year showed students came more than 90 countries.

The federal government has revoked the visas of some international students studying at universities across Illinois, but college administrators are sharing few details, including how many students have been impacted.

A spokesperson for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign this week confirmed that some of its students are affected, but did not disclose a number. U of I ranks sixth nationally in the size of its international student body at over 15,000.

“Out of student privacy concerns, we are not sharing specific information, but we are working directly with affected students to help them connect with appropriate resources and understand their options,” said Robin Kaler, a university spokesperson. Kaler declined to provide more details, though multiple sources familiar with the situation at U of I, who asked that their names not be used because they are not authorized to speak on the matter, say the number of students whose visas have been revoked is at least several dozen — and likely growing.

The revocations are part of a broader federal crackdown playing out on campuses across the country. International students have faced abrupt visa cancellations in recent weeks, as the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration dragnet ensnares college students, federal officials claim have violated visa rules, though the reasons for the revocations are not always made clear. In many cases, students have also lost their status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, which allows them to legally stay in the U.S. while enrolled in school.

Across its vast network of public and private colleges and universities, Illinois hosts one of the largest international student populations in the nation, ranking fifth, with more than 55,000 international students, according to a 2024 Open Doors report.

A spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker’s office said it has been in “close touch” with both public and private university leaders across the state but declined to share any information about how many students have been affected — or whether it even knows. The spokesperson said Pritzker’s office is deferring to the universities to provide data on what is “an incredibly fluid situation.”

Ed Yohnka, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said the lack of transparency from both federal officials and universities raises serious concerns about accountability and democratic oversight. It also makes it difficult for advocacy groups like his to provide a meaningful response to affected students.

“One of the things we often think about when we think about the First Amendment, or we think about free speech is that I can’t speak freely about what the government’s doing if I don’t know they’re doing it. I can’t actually exercise my constitutional right to participate, criticize and critique the government if, in fact, the government acts in such an opaque way that I can’t know what the heck they’re doing,” he said.

“And, so I think that’s why, if the federal government won’t share this information — if they’re trying to, sort of, just sneak one by here — this is where it gets incredibly important for universities to at least give some sort of number, some sort of range, to say that people in their community are being impacted and affected by these reckless and unlawful government policies.”

Many schools are citing privacy laws, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as to why they cannot disclose information about student visas.

SIU professor William Freivogel said that while the FERPA bars university disclosure of a student’s visa status unless the student gives written permission, the university should release anonymized data — without student names or identifying information.

“If the university is concerned that a student is losing the[ir] visa without the government presenting adequate reasons, the university can ask the student if it can disclose the information,” said Freivogel, who specializes in media law. “Presumably the governor’s office, if concerned about the situation statewide, could try to collect information in the same way — asking students if they want to waive their FERPA rights so that people can get a better picture of what is happening statewide and nationwide.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in late March that student visas are being revoked because select international students came to the U.S. to study, but instead engaged in “activist movements that are disruptive and undermine universities,” through protests on campus, specifically those that “are supportive of movements that run counter to the foreign policy of the United States.” That includes those calling for support of the Palestinian people and a ceasefire in Gaza, although it is unclear what the U.S. considers to be “movements that run counter to the foreign policy of the United States.”

On Wednesday, April 9, the U.S. said it will begin monitoring immigrants’ social media pages for antisemitism.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for antisemitic violence and terrorism — think again.”

Under this new directive, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will consider social media content that indicates an immigrant “endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests” — which may lead to visa revocation and the inability to be reinstated.

Happening on campuses across the state

University officials in Illinois have not disclosed the reasons that their students have lost their visas, and in some cases said they don’t even know themselves.

Southern Illinois University Carbondale reported one student with a revoked visa in late March but has since declined to comment on whether additional students have been affected.

After the initial confirmation, an SIU spokesperson told a reporter it would “no longer confirm or share information” and is “devoting our resources and energies to supporting our international students.”

Meanwhile, SIU Edwardsville has confirmed that eight students, including three undergraduates and five graduate students, lost their visa status earlier this week.

A Northern Illinois University spokesperson confirmed Thursday that five international students there had lost their visas.

SIU Carbondale reported 875 international students for the fall of 2024, a 2.5% increase from the year prior, while NIU enrolled roughly 970 international students. As of spring 2025, SIU Edwardsville had 825 international students representing 69 countries.

The University of Chicago student newspaper, the Chicago Maroon, reported Wednesday that three current students and four recent graduates had lost their visas. International students at the University of Chicago make up nearly a quarter of its student body of roughly 16,000.

As university leaders try to balance student concerns, fears of retaliation in an increasingly fraught political climate and growing demands for transparency, some say they feel left in the dark. And they worry the lack of transparency could conceal the full scope of the federal government’s actions against international students nationwide.

“What is deeply distressing about the news — that an international student’s visa was revoked — is the chilling silence around it, which only adds to the sense that we are powerless in the face of multiple attacks on the very existence of universities as places of learning, questioning and nurturing the next generation,” said Jyotnsa Kapur, a professor in cinema and media studies and the director of the University Honors Program at SIU Carbondale.

Kapur said international students fear jeopardizing their education and citizenship status — and want the school to provide stronger backing.

“Students want the upper administration to show support for international students — not just send cautionary notes,” said Kapur, referring to the email sent out by the university to its international student body on March 28.

“I had a couple of students in my office — they don’t want their names to be known — but they told me that there is absolute alarm about what can happen. One student was taking an after-dinner walk and a car just sat there with its lights on for 15 minutes. The student was actually afraid they may be picked up by ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] like the Tufts student,” Kapur said.

Questioning the legality of these actions

Illinois state Rep. Katie Stuart, chair of the House Higher Education Committee, said she’s heard “lots of stories of visas being revoked” but also had no concrete numbers about the impact across Illinois.

“I think it would be helpful to put together a briefing for legislators to understand what the different institutions are doing to protect students because ultimately that’s our goal,” said Stuart, a Democrat whose district includes SIU Edwardsville. “But the answer really is — right now — we don’t know for sure what’s going on.”

Illinois Sen. Dale Fowler, a Republican whose district includes SIU Carbondale, also said he did not have any sense of the scope of the situation. “I would love to know for sure,” he said.

Lawyers and legal scholars have begun to question the legality of these actions from the federal government, on international student visas.

These uncharted legal waters — coupled with the looming threat of losing federal funding — have effectively pushed many U.S. colleges into a state of silence and compliance with the federal government.

Lauren Aronson, a clinical professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and director of its Immigration Law Clinic, said she is particularly worried about the university’s large population of students from China, who she believes are becoming a target.

“The purpose is xenophobia and racism — it’s about punishing countries that don’t fall in line,” she said.

Aronson said it’s her understanding that some of the students impacted haven’t participated in protests and don’t have criminal records.

“I’m hugely concerned,” she said. “The thing that is to me the most nefarious is the fear that is being instilled now into every international student, as there isn’t necessarily rhyme or reason about who will be targeted.”

Some SIU students have started to raise concerns to not only their administrators, but to their peers as well.

At a student government meeting on April 2, SIU student Dustin Kinney asked what they are doing for the safety and protection of international students and other marginalized groups on campus.

“I just thought it was important to mention, because there are students on this campus who are deathly scared of legal and academic retaliation.

Explosion of Visa Terminations

More than 1,800 students have lost their F-1 or J-1 student status as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration and alleged antisemitism, according to news reports and college statements. That’s far higher than Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s initial estimate of 300 students. (Scroll down for the full list of institutions of where students are affected.)

Rubio alleged students sought entrance into the U.S. “not just to study but to participate in movements that vandalize universities, harass students, take over buildings and cause chaos.” But aside from a few high-profile examples, it’s not clear exactly why most of the students have lost their legal status.

As students and colleges grapple with the changing legal landscape, lawsuits are starting to pile up. In at least 16 legal challenges, students argue that without their student status, they can’t stay in the country or work. The terminations are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not otherwise in accordance with law and the Constitution,” argues one lawsuit filed April 15. Some courts have reinstated students' legal standings, a policy change late on April 24 kickstarted the restoration of all terminated SEVIS statues.

Based on public reports and direct correspondence, Inside Higher Ed has compiled a data set of colleges and universities across the nation that have indicated visa revocations for current students or recent alumni. The database was first published April 8 and was last updated April 25.

Lawsuits Pile Up

At least 290 international students or recent graduates who had their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System records terminated by the federal government are fighting that decision across 65 lawsuits.

Students hope to get their terminations reversed and return to their work or studies. In 35 suits, plaintiffs have been successful, securing at least temporary orders from judges allowing them to stay in country.

The individuals represented in the lawsuits are associated with colleges and universities across the country and range from undergraduate students to postgraduates who are working under Optional Practical Training, which allows F-1 students to stay in the U.S. and work in a position that relates to their degree for a period of time after they graduate. At least 14 of the plaintiffs, but possibly more, were slated to graduate in the next six months until a SEVIS termination interrupted their studies."

Catch and Revoke is an initiative of the US State Department to use artificial intelligence to identify international students it describes as ""pro-Hamas"" based on their activity on social media and revoke their student visas.[1][2] Axios published that the initiative is ""a dramatic escalation in the U.S. government's policing of foreign nationals' conduct and speech.""[1]

The State Department is examining internal databases to see if any visa holders were arrested during the Biden administration and remained in the country.[1]

It is also reviewing news reports of pro-Palestinian protests and demonstrations and pro-Israel Jewish students' lawsuits for any foreign nationals who engaged in what they describe as antisemitic activity.[1]

""They're scared and that's what the Trump administration wants,"" said Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations San Francisco Bay Area. ""That's what they're attempting to do here and we need universities to step up to protect their students.""

Administrators at several schools said they are providing resources to the international students impacted and encouraging them to get an attorney.

Stanford on Tuesday said additional students were impacted, but declined to update its numbers.

The wave of revocations follows reports of detainments at some colleges around the country. In Massachusetts, protests were held at Tufts University after a PhD students was detained by ICE steps from campus and had her visa terminated.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the student of supporting Hamas and the activists claim the wave of cancelled visas appears to be targeting foreign-born students who participate in political activism.

""Once you've lost your visa, you're no longer legally able to be in the United States and we have a right like every country in the world has a right to remove you from our country,"" Rubio said.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it is too early to tell if all of the students impacted were active in protests.

""The Trump administration is making good on its promise to target immigrants and to clamp down on free speech,"" Billoo said. ""It is now time for all of us to make good on our promise to resist and to protect each other.""

International students in the Bay Area are discovering their student visas have been revoked. Emma Goss has the latest details.

Andrew Newcomb, a San Jose immigration attorney, said the feds have the legal right to revoke student visas because they are considered discretionary.

""What we're seeing now is a significant departure of what used to be the framework for revoking people's student visas, which generally about failing to maintain academic standing or representing some kind of public safety [risk],"" Newcomb said.

But for students who may be detained, Newcomb also said there are ways to fight it.

""People do have the procedural right to file a habeas petition outside of immigration court in a federal court, which challenges the government's ability to be able to detain someone and forces them to produce some kind of evidence of criminal wrongdoing,"" Newcomb said.

Anyone concerned about their visa status should first call an immigration attorney, experts said."
https://time.com/7284578/judge-orders-release-of-rumeysa-ozturk-tuft-student-detained-by-ice/,"Judge Orders Release of Rümeysa Öztürk, Tufts Student Detained by ICE","A federal judge on Friday ordered the immediate release of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish Ph.D. student at Tufts University who had been held for six weeks in an immigration detention center, ruling that her arrest and continued confinement were unlawful and raised serious constitutional concerns. Judge William K. Sessions III of the U.S. District Court in Vermont found that Öztürk, who was detained in March after co-authoring a pro-Palestinian op-ed in her campus newspaper, had been targeted for her speech in a manner that violated her First Amendment and due process rights. The ruling is a sharp rebuke of the Trump administration’s use of visa revocations and deportation proceedings against foreign students accused of dissenting from U.S. foreign policy.

Advertisement Advertisement

“There is no evidence here… absent consideration of the op-ed,” Sessions said in court, describing the government’s case as hinging entirely on her protected speech. “Her continued detention cannot stand.” Öztürk, who appeared virtually from an ICE facility in Louisiana, was ordered released without restrictions on her travel, allowing her to return to her home in Massachusetts. The ruling was announced as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was in the midst of a briefing with reporters. When asked about the decision, Leavitt suggested Sessions had overstepped. “We’ve made quite clear that lower level judges should not be dictating the foreign policy of the United States,"" Leavitt said. Later on Friday, Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, announced that the Administration is “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge a person’s detention by the government when the U.S. has been invaded or during an insurrection. Habeas corpus has only been suspended four times since the ratification of the Constitution: during the Civil War; in South Carolina during Reconstruction to combat the Ku Klux Klan; in the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection; and in Hawaii after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. “The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion,” Miller said, just days after a New York federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had not shown evidence that there was a foreign invasion to justify using the Alien Enemies Act for deportations.

Sessions’ order in the Öztürk case comes amid mounting scrutiny of President Donald Trump’s policy of revoking student visas on the basis of perceived political threats. Since returning to office, Trump has directed his administration to act aggressively against foreign nationals who the Administration has alleged are undermining American interests, particularly in the context of criticism of Israel and campus protests against the war in Gaza. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who revoked Öztürk’s visa, said her presence in the U.S. was contrary to American foreign policy interests and suggested she had aligned herself with groups hostile to Jewish students. A State Department memo cited the op-ed she co-authored and alleged links to a student organization that was temporarily suspended by Tufts. “We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses,” Rubio told reporters. “If we’ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we’re going to take it away.”

The administration has provided no evidence of criminal activity or direct support for a terrorist group, and immigration authorities have not charged her with a crime. But the Department of Homeland Security has argued that visa holders like Öztürk can be expelled at the discretion of the executive branch. Judge Sessions forcefully rejected that view, warning that the government’s actions could chill speech by “millions and millions” of noncitizens who live, study, and work in the United States. Öztürk’s detention had sparked national protest and viral outrage after video emerged of masked federal agents surrounding her on a Somerville, Mass., sidewalk in March and forcing her into an unmarked vehicle. Since then, she has been held over 1,300 miles away in Louisiana, where her health has deteriorated significantly according to her lawyers. They said she suffers from chronic asthma and has experienced repeated attacks in detention—including one during Friday’s hearing.

“I believe the world is a more beautiful and peaceful place when we listen to each other and allow different perspectives to be in the room,” Öztürk said in a statement read by her attorney in early April. “Writing is one of the most peaceful ways of addressing systemic inequality. Efforts to target me because of my op-ed in the Tufts Daily calling for the equal dignity and humanity of all people will not deter me from my commitment to advocate for the rights of youth and children.” The ruling marks the second time in recent weeks that a Vermont federal judge has ordered the release of an international student caught in the Trump administration’s visa crackdown. Last month, Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University who was detained for participating in campus protests. The administration has argued that such revocations fall squarely within the executive branch’s authority. “We absolutely believe the President and the Department of Homeland Security are well within their legal rights to deport illegal immigrants,” Leavitt said Friday. “As for visa revocations, the Secretary of State has the right to do that as well. It is a privilege, not a right to come to this country on a visa.”

But Öztürk, 30, was in the U.S. legally on a student visa when she was apprehended. Legal experts say her case could set precedent on whether visa-holders have constitutional rights in immigration custody, and whether political expression can lawfully trigger removal proceedings.

While Judge Sessions’s ruling pertains only to her release from detention, the Trump administration’s broader deportation case against Öztürk is expected to proceed in immigration court."

Over 1,700 international students from more than 270 colleges and universities have had their F-1 visas revoked as of Wednesday, April 23, according to Inside Higher Ed.

This is the only known revocation of an ECC international student’s visa amid a nationwide rise in student visa revocations. The ECC student was not identified during the meeting.

F-1 visas allow foreign nationals to study at academic institutions in the United States. The recent revocations come after the Trump administration effected two executive orders in January related to visa authorization and enforcement.

Amy Herrschaft, counselor for the International Student Program at ECC, said during the meeting that information received from the federal government about the situation is vague.

Herrschaft said that ECC was given a standard statement which said the action was “background-check related” or a “visa revocation.”

“We just know that [the student’s] records with us, as an international student, are no longer valid,” she said. “But that information is not given to us and limited information is given to the student as well.”

Lillian Justice, registrar at Enrollment Services, said during the meeting that the student is still considered enrolled at ECC.

Several student newspapers at community colleges in California have reported visa revocations happening to students at other institutions.

A visa revocation occurred to one student in the Los Rios Community College District according to the American River Current as of Wednesday, April 9.

Nine students from the Foothill-De Anza Community College District, which operates two colleges in Northern California, had their visas either revoked or terminated, according to La Voz News as of Friday, April 11.

Two students at Pasadena City College had their visas revoked according to the Courier as of Tuesday, April 15.

At Santa Monica College, ten student visas have been “terminated,” according to the Corsair as of Wednesday, April 22.

The number of ECC students holding F-1 visas in fall 2024 was 341, which comprised 1.5% of enrollment, according to the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office Data Mart, an online database of statistics from the state’s two-year colleges.

Thames said the CCCO is collecting information on international student visa revocations from college campuses across the state.

Herrshaft said that some international students may not have access to higher education in their home countries.

“We don’t want to eliminate that opportunity to come here and study on an F-1 visa,” Herrshaft said during the meeting. “I think that it’s a balancing act for sure in terms of making sure we’re continuing to support our students.”

Alireza Ahmadpour, art history professor and College Council facilities steering committee voter, said the campus community should be informed about the revocation.

“I think we should inform the rest of the community, the other students… to see what they can do to stand up for their classmates,” Ahmadpour said. “My point is, we can create movements against this nonsense.”

This is a developing story."

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Students from India typically embrace a lifestyle in US that is said to revolve around ""apartment and department."" Older graduate students may be a little more adventurous, shuttling between ""Advisor and Budweiser."" The rare ones who are audacious enough to dabble in political activism got a salutary warning this week with the Trump administration revoking the student visa of a Chinese scholar in California for participating in pro-Palestinian rallies on the campus.The State Department did not name the student but social media posts identified her as Liu Lijun, a grad student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Liu came to prominence after her arrest in May 2024 following campus unrest tied to the Israel-Hamas war after the Palestinian extremist group attacked Israel. While some reports characterized her as an organizer leading the protests against Israel's retaliation, others said she was only a participant whose arrest pitched her into the limelight.Speculation about foreign student visa revocations has been in the air for weeks after President Trump signed an executive order on January 29 aimed at combating what the administration described as rising antisemitism and harassment of Jewish students on college campuses. The order specifically targeted international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, authorizing the Departments of Education, State, and Homeland Security to monitor and report activities by foreign students and staff that could lead to investigations and, if warranted, visa revocations or deportations.Liu Lijun's visa revocation is said to be the first of its kind in recent times and comes on the heels of the Trump administration canning $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University for failing to fight anti-semitism on campus. Nine other universities, including George Washington University; Harvard University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California, are under scrutiny, with Justice Department officials visiting them to look into political activism by foreign students, which more extreme MAGA elements characterize as support for terrorists.Thousands of students from India are studying at these campuses, all located in Democrat-run states and liberal enclaves in the US. India is now the leading country of origin for international students in the U.S., with 331,602 Indian students enrolled in American higher education institutions, a 23% increase from the prior year when China was the top country.Trump himself has railed against ""woke"" and 'liberal"" activism on campuses, which he says are dominated by the ""radical left"" or ""Marxist"" influences that prioritize gender identity discussions and critical race theory at the expense of traditional American principles. After he delivered a $ 400million blow to Columbia this week, the White House trolled the university, posting a photo of Trump with the message ""Shalom Columbia!""Most universities, including Columbia, are quickly falling in line even as civil liberties activists are raging about the war on free speech and peaceful protests which have long been the hallmark of American campuses. But MAGA hardliners argue that right cannot be exercised by foreign students, least of all those from China, whose government would not allow protests by its own citizens.Not everyone is convinced about the Trump dispensation's stance on anti-semitism though. ""Revoking federal grants to Columbia University isn’t about combating anti-Semitism; it’s about the Trump administration’s war on education and science. If the Trump administration were as serious about anti-Semitism ... they would not have filled their ranks with unapologetic antisemites,"" Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler said.""Today's announcement does nothing to keep Jewish students safe and sends a chilling message that universities must align with the MAGA agenda or face financial ruin,"" he added."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/05/03/international-students-campus-protest-visas/,"For international students, protesting on campuses has higher stakes","Momodou Taal did not think he would be facing suspension and potentially having his visa revoked for protesting war at a school that just spent its academic year celebrating freedom of expression. A doctoral student from the United Kingdom, Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell University last week for taking part in a protest encampment and staying past the 8 p.m. curfew, according to a letter he shared with The Washington Post. He said he was at the pro-Palestinian demonstration as part of a team negotiating with administrators.

“I was in a complete sense of shock when I received the suspension letter,” Taal told The Post, adding he was “disappointed.” He does not know whether the suspension will be lifted, if at all.

Since late October, college and university students across the country have been setting up encampments to protest Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and demanding that their schools cut financial ties to Israel. The efforts garnered national attention in mid-April when police arrested more than 100 protesters at Columbia University, leading students at other schools to prop up encampments. Since then, more than 2,000 protesters have been arrested, according to a Post tally of news reports and police and university statements, and many others have been suspended or called to disciplinary hearings by universities.

American students are left to deal with a barrage of issues including arrests and suspensions, but international students have an added burden — the threat of losing their visas and potentially being forced to leave the country. Some international students say they are on the path to suspension for protesting, while others told The Post they are expecting to receive letters that could lead to suspension.

“The repercussions are different for international students because their visas and visa status is tried to them being an active student at a university,” said Bhavya Chaudhary, an immigration attorney who handles international student visas. “If they are suspended, that could mean a termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record, which is the basis of their visa to the U.S.”

Chaudhary said it’s possible that a short or temporary suspension may not impact a student’s visa, but the moment an international student fails to maintain a full course of credit or if they are convicted of a crime, their visa is in jeopardy.

Schools have 21 days to inform the Department of Homeland Security of a suspension — or disciplinary action taken because of a criminal conviction — and once a student’s SEVIS record is terminated, their presence in the United States becomes unlawful, and they have 15 days to leave the country.

A DHS. official told The Post that so far, no students have had visas terminated because of participation in campus protests.

Taal, a Black student in the Africana studies department who was suspended along with three other students, said he finds the suspensions shocking, given that the university celebrates the 1969 student occupation that led to the creation of the Afro-American Studies Center at Cornell.

“The university has a history of struggle and activism, and Palestine is part of that,” he said. “I felt disgusted that the university would steep to such punitive measures for people protesting a genocide.”

Israel denies that it is carrying out genocide in Gaza. A case brought before the International Court of Justice by South Africa alleges that Israel is violating international law by committing and not preventing genocidal acts.

Bianca Waked, a Canadian national and a doctoral student at Cornell who has also been temporarily suspended, said she wasn’t part of the encampment because she was aware of the added risk as an international student who is of Lebanese descent, but joined the negotiating team.

Like Taal, Waked said she was only in the encampment area the night before receiving the suspension letter to negotiate with the administration. Waked particularly took issue with a letter from administration saying she’d been “unreasonably loud.”

“I am a deaf woman who cannot regulate for volume,” she said during a video interview. “I take personal offense at that accusation.”

Asked about Waked’s and Taal’s suspensions, Cornell directed The Post to the university president’s statement from April 29 that said the students had been “dishonest in their request, stating that there would not be tents and that the art installation would be removed by 8 p.m. on Thursday.” The statement said the encampment was proving disruptive to the campus and impacting public safety.

The Post could not verify how many international students participated in the ongoing campus protests. Students at various universities, however, told The Post international students had been playing significant roles as speakers, teachers and general supporters, while avoiding encampments and other areas where the risk of arrest or suspension was high.

Even then, Waked at Cornell said: “People don’t fully realize how much international students are risking right now.”

Waked said the suspension has created confusion about her legal status in the country. She said administrators have ignored her questions on whether she should be packing her bags or keep grading papers for the class she taught this semester.

If it comes down to being suspended and losing her visa, Waked said she is prepared.

“This administration is trying to shut down peaceful protests by using us and our suspensions as bargaining chips to shut down the camp and no one will give in to that tactic,” she said. “This encampment is bigger than a suspension because it’s about protecting Palestinian lives.”

<b>Facing added consequences</b>

Johnny Hazboun, a Palestinian Jordanian student at Purdue University, had already bought a ticket to go home to Jordan for his summer vacation when he received a letter April 30 about a code of conduct violation that is a pathway to suspension, he said.

In a letter seen by The Post, the administration accused Hazboun of occupying a university building and putting up a structure on school property and not taking it down after a warning. He said three other students of color also got the letter.

Hazboun and Ishan Tripathi, another international student facing similar accusations deny all charges. They said they complied with university guidelines every step of the way and even agreed to disassemble the encampment structure they had put up.

At the last moment, however, it started raining and students felt it was unsafe to dismantle while the ground was wet. They emailed administrators about the delay, and the officials appeared to understand, according to screenshots of emails seen by The Post.

Still, the next day, they received letters. Purdue did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Hazboun is concerned about disappointing his parents if his hearing leads to a suspension, but said “some risks are worth taking.”

“Palestine is bigger than me, you, all of us,” he said. “I keep thinking whatever happens to me is nothing compared to what the people of Gaza have been through and are still going through.”

Organizers at campus protests across the country have been helping students evaluate their options. A spokesperson for Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, a student group at Harvard University helping organize the encampment there, said that they “have a responsibility to advise that international students are especially cautious when assessing risk.”

Some students elsewhere haven’t received letters yet, but are expecting the worst.

Sonya Epifantseva, an undergraduate ecology student, was eager to come to Stanford University because she faced a lot of backlash for her environmental activism back home in Russia.

“When I first came I was idealizing and romanticizing the U.S. a lot,” she said. “I felt proud to be a student here.”

Seeing the way U.S. universities have treated student protesters recently, Epifantseva no longer feels that way, she said.

Epifantseva was part of the Stanford’s first encampment in October. For the second encampment, which began last month, the university barred overnight camping and disrupting classes or events. Epifantseva, afraid of being suspended and losing her visa, has been careful to follow the rules to avoid disciplinary proceedings, which are a pathway to suspensions.

“But it may not matter,” she said. “Lots of students who are not camping now but did camp last year are receiving the letters.”

As protests gather strength nationally, some international students are changing how they calculate risk.

Iman Iftikhar, a Pakistani student about to attend her graduation at Yale University, has been supporting the encampment from the sidelines because of her student visa status. Now she is feeling a sense of guilt about this decision, even as 53 have been arrested on campus.

“Palestine is so much bigger than university disciplinary action or one student facing the consequences of trying to advocate for civil justice on a university campus,” the history and philosophy major said. “In the worst case, I wouldn’t get my diploma or I would get deported, but I am leaving soon in any case.”"

1.1 million international students studied in the United States during the 2023-24 academic year, according to a recent report released by the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the Institute of Education. Two of the top five largest host schools for international students are located in New York City — NYU came in at #1 and Columbia University ranked third. However, over the last several weeks, the Trump administration’s move to attack universities and deport hundreds of international students here on visas has led to widespread panic, in New York and elsewhere.

While recent reports indicate that the U.S. government is reversing the termination of some student visas following a wave of court challenges against the Trump administration’s crackdown, we recognize that this remains an overwhelming and uncertain situation for many. We also know that knowledge is power, so we teamed up with Immigrant ARC (I-ARC), a network of legal advocates and an institute for immigration law training and policy, to break down some of your biggest questions about student visa revocations, terminations and your security in the United States.

What are the reasons my visa might be revoked?

The U.S. Department of State has broad discretion to revoke visas. Historically, international students could lose their legal status in the U.S. if they violated the terms of their F-1 visa — this could include things such as failing to maintain full-time enrollment, working off-campus during their first year, lacking sufficient financial support, or failing to keep a permanent residence abroad.

Visas can also be revoked for more serious reasons, including criminal activity, national security concerns, misrepresentation, or fraud.

Today however, the State Department is targeting students who it says came to the U.S. “not just to study but to participate in movements that vandalize universities, harass students, take over buildings, and cause chaos.” College officials report however, that several affected students were neither involved in campus demonstrations nor considered activists.

Some universities also report that students have had their visas revoked over minor or past offenses—such as traffic violations, underage drinking, or trespassing — even in cases that were later dismissed.

I’m an international student and my visa was revoked or terminated. What should I do?

If your visa has been revoked or terminated, you may be eligible to request a reinstatement of your status. If you’re looking for an immigration attorney to assist with your case, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) is a great resource — you can even search for the exact kind of lawyer you need right here.



Side note: if you leave the U.S. before you hit 180 days of unlawful presence, you may still be able to reapply and reenter the United States.

Does my political speech put me at risk of immigration enforcement?

It depends. Visa holders do not enjoy the same freedom of speech protections as U.S. citizens. If you’re a student inside the U.S. and are worried about your visa, you need to know that the U.S. State Department can revoke a visa at any time for reasons related to national interest or criminal concerns.

It’s important to remember that your student visa is merely a travel document; your actual immigration status is governed by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE has the authority to access the SEVIS system and terminate a student’s status at any time.

Will a previous encounter with law enforcement be an issue when I try to enter the U.S. or reapply for a visa?

It’s possible. For students outside the U.S. any interaction with law enforcement, regardless of whether it resulted in a conviction, can raise concerns when you seek to enter the United States or apply for a new visa.

Important to note: The passage of time does not necessarily matter. If you have had any prior encounters with law enforcement, whether it was long ago or not, we strongly recommend consulting with an immigration attorney before making any travel plans.

What is the difference between student visa termination and cancellation?

A student visa termination occurs within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a web-based database that tracks nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors (F-1 and J-1) in the United States. SEVIS is administered by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) under the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, a student’s SEVIS record is terminated by their university when the student has changed their status, withdrawn from their program, or failed to maintain lawful immigration status. However, in recent cases, SEVIS terminations have been initiated directly by the U.S. government rather than by universities.

A visa revocation, or cancellation, is carried out by the U.S. Department of State, which involves invalidating a previously issued visa stamp in an individual’s passport. Once revoked, the visa can no longer be used for entry into the United States, regardless of its expiration date. Students are generally notified of a visa revocation by the U.S. Embassy or Consulate, but universities are typically not informed.

Here’s a helpful chart, courtesy of Immigrant ARC:

What happens if I am placed in removal proceedings?

If a student’s visa is revoked, ICE can begin deportation proceedings under various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The formal removal process, however, begins when ICE files a Notice to Appear (NTA) with immigration court. This document outlines the charges and legal basis for removal. The student then has the right to challenge these charges in court. ICE must prove the student is removable with “clear and convincing evidence.” If the government fails to meet that burden, the case should be dismissed.

If a student is found removable, they may still apply for relief — such as asylum or cancellation of removal. If no relief is granted, they may be ordered removed.

It’s important to note that these cases can move quickly and legal representation is essential, especially since many students may not know about options available to them. For more details, see the Immigrant Legal Resource Center’s Overview of the Deportation Process.

Has your visa been revoked? Consider getting involved.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) is currently gathering information from individuals whose student visas have been revoked and whose SEVIS records have been terminated. The responses will be used to support AILA’s advocacy efforts on this issue.



If you’d like to contribute, you can complete this survey, many of the fields are optional. While AILA is leading this data collection effort, it’s important to understand that they do not offer direct legal representation, and filling out the form does not establish an attorney-client relationship.

Increasing numbers of reports indicate that students are facing visa revocations and the termination of their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)—actions that carry significant immigration and employment consequences.

According to public statements by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the U.S. Department of State has revoked more than 300 student visas, citing alleged involvement in criminal activity. Separately, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) has reported that since January 20, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has terminated over 4,700 SEVIS records.

Visa Revocations vs. Status Termination

It is important to distinguish between visa stamp revocations and status termination. A visa stamp, issued by the U.S. Department of State, allows entry to the U.S. but does not confer legal status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants individuals status when they are admitted to the U.S. That status is maintained as long as the individual remains compliant with the terms of the visa category. This means that even if a visa stamp is revoked, the individual may still lawfully remain in the U.S. unless and until DHS acts to terminate their status or initiate removal proceedings.

Since the F-1 visa stamp does not connote an individual’s legal status in the U.S., even if a visa stamp expires or is revoked, the student’s status in the U.S. may continue to be valid. Recent F-1 visa stamp revocations are notable, as the Foreign Affairs Manual generally restricts revocations for individuals already in the U.S., with narrow exceptions (such as certain health-related grounds). In these recent cases, the Department of State has relied on INA § 237(a)(4)(C), which permits visa revocation based on a reasonable belief that the individual may pose adverse foreign policy consequences. While this provision grants broad discretion, its use in the context of F-1 student visas has raised questions, given its potential far reaching and longer term impacts.

The more immediate challenge for F-1 students, however, arises from SEVIS record terminations. SEVIS, maintained by DHS, is used to track, and monitor compliance with the terms of F-1 status—including full-time enrollment, address updates, and authorized employment. Historically, it was understood that a terminated SEVIS record strips a student of their lawful status, leading to invalidation of their F-1 work authorization (including OPT and STEM OPT). However, in recent litigation pertaining to the government’s actions concerning F-1 students, a senior official at DHS stated a contrary position, raising questions about the precise impact of the SEVIS terminations.

Who is Impacted?

Reports from NAFSA, the Association of International Educators, indicate that those impacted include undergraduate, graduate, and Optional Practical Training (OPT)/STEM OPT students. In addition, they report that there does not appear to be a clear pattern or trend in the nationalities of the affected international students; and students at all types of higher education institutions across the U.S. are impacted.

SEVIS Termination and Legal Challenges

Many terminations appear to be based on preliminary or minor incidents, such as traffic infractions, arrests that did not result in conviction, or charges that were later dismissed. In some cases, terminations appear to have been triggered by background checks, without consideration of due process, final adjudication, or the student’s current academic standing.

Notably, affected students often receive no advance notice or explanation, only learning that their status has been terminated or their visa revoked after the fact. In some instances, universities have also been left in the dark.

In response to the SEVIS terminations, multiple lawsuits have been filed nationwide, challenging the legality of these actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections.​ Although the litigation is ongoing, several courts have already granted temporary restraining orders that reinstate the students’ F-1 status.

For example, a court in Washington found that a termination based on a pending DUI charge was likely unlawful under the APA because DHS failed to follow its own regulations, which limit agency-initiated terminations to specific grounds, none of which applied to the student. The court also noted the lack of explanation and due process, holding that the student was likely to succeed on his claim that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The decision affirmed that F-1 SEVIS terminations are final agency actions subject to judicial review, especially when they carry immediate legal consequences, and no meaningful administrative appeal exists.

While the State Department has not released any specific criteria for SEVIS termination, it has stated generally that the focus is on international students who have had past arrests, criminal charges, or convictions, as well as any behavior that’s been deemed to be of concern to the current administration. Typically, those affected by SEVIS terminations are provided written notice, yet international students and universities are reporting that some of these terminations have had no advance warnings. Lack of notice in either context is concerning in light of the possible impact on the individual’s legal status in the U.S.

Adding to the confusion and uncertainty are the government’s more recent position in the litigation that termination of an individual’s SEVIS record does not, in fact, terminate their status in the U.S. In Deore et al. v. Secretary of U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., four international students studying at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University brought suit against DHS for termination of their SEVIS records, alleging violations of the APA and due process rights. In response, the government submitted an affidavit from Andre Watson, Senior Official within the National Security Division (NSD) for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Mr. Watson attested that “[t]erminating a record in SEVIS does not terminate an individual’s nonimmigrant status in the United States. The statute and regulations do not provide SEVP the authority to terminate nonimmigrant status by terminating a SEVIS record, and SEVP has never claimed that it had terminated the nonimmigrant status of [the students]. Furthermore, the authority to issue or revoke visas for nonimmigrant students lies with the Department of State, not SEVP. Terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation.”

Since the government has stated that it has no reason to believe that a status change has occurred, this has now created legal uncertainty for individuals whose SEVIS records have been terminated. Due to the lack of clarity on the question of status, the court denied the TRO on the basis that it was unable to determine whether the students suffered irreparable harm, as there was no clear answer on whether the students did, in fact, lose their F-1 status when the SEVIS record was terminated. The court requested additional briefing on this point and also addressed the potential impact on employment, stating, “it remains unclear whether the students have F-1 status despite the termination of their SEVIS record, have lost their F-1 status, or anything else. The parties did not thoroughly analyze whether someone with F-1 status but without a SEVIS record (insofar as such a person can exist) may be employed.”

Impact on Employers

For U.S. employers, these developments create uncertainty—particularly for those employing students on F-1 OPT or STEM OPT. Most international students are eligible for the F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows F-1 students to work in the United States for up to twelve (12) months in a job that is related to their area of study. International students who have earned a degree in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) fields are eligible for an additional twenty-four (24) months of work authorization, for a total of thirty-six months of F-1 OPT and STEM OPT.

Proactive Measures for Employers and Institutions

Document carefully. Ensure that job duties align with OPT/STEM OPT guidelines and maintain clear records of compliance.

Monitor legal developments. Court rulings may inform future enforcement trends and policy shifts.

Prepare for contingency. Have protocols in place should an employee’s work authorization suddenly terminate.

As litigation proceeds, it remains critical for stakeholders—including employers, universities, and affected students—to monitor developments and adhere to policies that maintain compliance with federal regulations.

During the second presidency of Donald Trump, the United States has pursued a policy of targeting political dissidents, particularly pro-Palestinian international students and academics, for deportation.[1][2][3][4] As of April 17, 2025, over 1,000 international students and graduates have had their visas revoked or their status terminated.[5]

Background [ edit ]

The United States has long used its immigration policy as a tool for political control, particularly during the First and Second Red Scare. During the Palmer Raids, hundreds of left-wing immigrants were deported due to their political activities. Deportation was used to circumvent their constitutional rights when they could not be charged with a crime in the domestic legal system. Fear of immigrant radicalism led to the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which expanded the powers of the government to investigate and deport immigrants for their political beliefs.[6]

In August 2015, during his 2016 campaign, Trump proposed the mass deportation of illegal immigrants as a part of his immigration policy.[7] He proposed a ""Deportation Force"" to carry out this plan, modeled after the 1950s-era ""Operation Wetback"" program during the Dwight Eisenhower administration that ended following a congressional investigation.[8] He returned to this idea during his 2024 presidential campaign, and blurred the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and has promised to deport both.[9] To achieve the goal of deporting millions per year, Trump stated his intent to expand deportations without due process, which would be accomplished by the expedited removal authorities of 8 U.S. Code § 1225; invoking the Alien Enemies Act within the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798; and invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to allow the military to apprehend migrants and thus bypass the Posse Comitatus Act.[10]

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids would be expanded to include workplace raids and sweeps in public places. Following arrest, Stephen Miller has stated that illegal immigrants would be taken to ""large-scale staging grounds near the border, most likely in Texas"", to be held in internment camps prior to deportation. Trump told a rally audience in September 2024 that the deportation effort ""will be a bloody story.""[11][12]

Use of social media to identify potential deportees [ edit ]

The administration is reportedly using an artificial intelligence ""catch and revoke"" program to scrape social media posts and identify students who allegedly support Hamas.[13] A number of detained and deported activists have been targeted by doxing campaigns prior to their arrest.[14][15][16]

On March 25, 2025, the state department issued a directive stating that visa applicants would be ineligible if their social media activity indicated that they were ""advocating for, sympathizing with, or persuading others to endorse or espouse terrorist activities or support a designated foreign terrorist organization"", and that similar activity could result in the revocation of existing visas.[17] On April 9, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it will screen social media accounts for what it deems to be ""antisemitic"".[18][19]

Targeting of higher education [ edit ]

The administration has focused its catch and revoke program on foreign students who have engaged in pro-Palestinian speech, characterizing them as pro-Hamas. The government plans to use its Student and Exchange Visitor Program to review institutions of higher education that have had significant pro-Palestinian protests, suggesting that it may decertify those institutions, making them ineligible to enroll student visa holders. Revocation of student visas also threatens a revenue stream for colleges and universities, with one senior Department of Justice official saying ""That's one of their biggest cash cows, foreign students.""[20]

On April 8, 2025, in response to the large number of student visa revocations, Inside Higher Ed started tracking the number of known visa revocations for students and recent alumni, and mapping the colleges and universities reporting visa revocations. As of the morning of April 9, the tracker showed 419 students and recent alumni from over 80 institutions of higher education across the U.S. In many cases, immigration authorities have not notified the institutions of the reasons for the visa revocations.[21]

The American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association filed suit against the Trump administration, arguing that it is promoting an ""ideological-deportation policy"" that harms not only those the administration is attempting to deport, but also university communities more generally, and that pursuing students and faculty on the basis of their views is unconstitutional.[22] The plaintiffs, represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, filed their suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and asserted that the policy violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The Trump administration moved that the case be dismissed for lack of standing, and also claimed that there was no ideological-deportation policy and that the district court didn't have jurisdiction over immigration enforcement. The case was assigned to Judge William Young, and on April 30, 2025, Young dismissed the Fifth Amendment challenge, but ruled that the First Amendment challenge could proceed, saying ""It is well established that noncitizens have at least some First Amendment rights, and political speech is ‘at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect.’""[23]

Cases [ edit ]

Rasha Alawieh [ edit ]

Rasha Alawieh was born in 1990. She is a Lebanese transplant nephrologist who had worked as an assistant professor at Brown University. [24] She is a Shia Muslim.[25]

Alawieh obtained her medical degree from the American University of Beirut in 2015. She completed her residency at the American University of Beirut Medical Center in 2018.[26] That year, she obtained a J-1 visa[26] to enter the United States and completed fellowships at Ohio State University and the University of Washington.[27] She completed the Yale Waterbury Internal Medicine Program in June 2024, the same month the United States' government approved Alawieh's petition for an H-1B visa, sponsored by Brown Medicine.[28] This visa was issued at the Lebanese consulate on March 11, 2025 and was valid through mid-2027.[28]

Yunseo Chung [ edit ]

Chung is a Columbia University student who came to the United States from South Korea at age 7 and is a lawful permanent resident with a green card. On March 5, she was among a group of protesters arrested during a sit-in at Barnard College to express solidarity with protesting students who had been expelled. On March 10, federal law enforcement told her lawyer that her permanent resident status was being revoked. Agents searched for Chung at her dorm and her parents' home, though she was not there. Chung's lawyer filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the case was assigned to judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, who ruled that Chung could not be detained for the time being.[33][34][35]

Federal agents had searched for Chung at various Columbia residences pursuant to a federal criminal warrant for harboring out-of-status noncitizens. The use of that warrant indicates that the government was likely pursuing a criminal case against Columbia wider than an immigration action against a single person.[36]

Alireza Doroudi [ edit ]

Alireza Doroudi, a University of Alabama doctoral student from Iran, was arrested by ICE on March 25, 2025. Doroudi was studying mechanical engineering on a F-1 visa. Doroudi's lawyer stated that he had not been charged with any crime and had not participated in anti-government protests. The University of Alabama chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine also denied that he had been involved in any protests with their organization. DHS claimed that Doroudi ""posed significant national security concerns"" but did not provide any further information.[37]

Aditya Wahyu Harsono [ edit ]

On March 27, 2025, Aditya Wahyu Harsono, an Indonesian citizen and hospital supply chain manager, had his visa revoked without notice[38] and was arrested by ICE at his workplace and detained in the basement of the hospital in Marshall, Minnesota before being transferred to Kandiyohi County Jail. Harsono's attorney said that hospital management was coerced by ICE into staging a meeting so that he could be apprehended. Harsono was let go from his job following his arrest.[39] Harsono had been a participant in the Daunte Wright protests in 2021 where he was arrested for violating a curfew order.[40] He also frequently posted in support of Gaza on social media and runs a small nonprofit to raise money for aid to Gaza.[41]

Alfredo Juarez [ edit ]

On March 27, 2025, ICE stopped Alfredo Juarez, a labor organizer on behalf of farm workers in Washington state. ICE agents stopped his car while he was driving his wife to work, broke his window, and dragged him out of the car. Juarez was taken to an ICE facility in Ferndale, and later to ICE's Northwest Processing Center in Tacoma. Juarez's lawyers and community members said that he was targeted for his activism.[42][43]

Mahmoud Khalil [ edit ]

Leqaa Kordia [ edit ]

On March 14, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had arrested another Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, for overstaying her visa. Kordia is a Palestinian from the West Bank and had been previously arrested for her involvement in a protest for Gaza. DHS called Kordia a Hamas supporter but did not provide any evidence to support this claim.[59]

Mohsen Mahdawi [ edit ]

On April 14, 2025, Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia University student and 10-year resident in the United States who was seeking US citizenship, was arrested at the ICE office in Colchester, Vermont after what he had been told would be a naturalization interview. While at Columbia, Mahdawi was one of the leaders of the pro-Palestinian protests. He had been targeted by pro-Israel groups and individuals online since 2024, including Canary Mission and Betar. Mahdawi went into hiding following the detention of Mahmoud Khalil and asked Columbia administrators to assist him in finding a safe place to live, which they refused to do. He is facing a deportation order to the West Bank, which he called ""a death sentence"" due to the ongoing and escalating Israeli incursions into the territory which have affected several members of his family.[60][61]

On April 14, 2025, Mahdawi's legal team filed a habeas corpus petition against Donald Trump and his administration, describing his detention as unlawful.[62] His lawyers requested a temporary restraining order to prevent him from being transferred out of Vermont by federal authorities. Vermont federal judge William K. Sessions III granted the request and ordered that Mahdawi remain in Vermont.[63] The case, in the District Court for the District of Vermont, was reassigned to Judge Geoffrey Crawford, and on April 30, Crawford granted Mahdawi's request to be released on bail, and said that the case raised a ""substantial claim that the government arrested him to stifle speech with which it disagrees.""[64] The Trump administration appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, asking the court for an emergency stay of Crawford's ruling and challenging the determination that Crawford had authority to make such a ruling. The case was assigned to judges Susan Carney, Alison Nathan, and Barrington Parker, and on May 9, they denied the appeal.[65]

Rümeysa Öztürk [ edit ]

Ranjani Srinivasan [ edit ]

Srinivasan, an Indian national and Fulbright scholar at Columbia, chose to self-deport after having her visa revoked. She had been previously detained during the Hamilton Hall protests, but all charges were dismissed. Her attorney said she was not a participant in the protests. Srinivasan was also accused without evidence of being a supporter of Hamas.[59][67]

Badar Khan Suri [ edit ]

Suri, a Georgetown University researcher from India with a student visa, was detained by federal immigration authorities on March 17, 2025.[68] The government revoked his visa, but did not charge him with a crime. He has no criminal record. Suri's lawyer argued in his petition to the court that Suri was targeted because of his US citizen wife's Palestinian heritage and because the government suspects that the couple opposes US foreign policy.[68] A 2018 article about the couple in the Hindustan Times said his wife's father served as a ""senior political adviser to the Hamas leadership"",[69] and a government spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, later accused him of ""actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism"" and having connections to a terrorist. Suri is being held in Texas, where an immigration court hearing is scheduled for May 6.[24] He has petitioned a district court in Virginia to return him to that state, where there is a hearing on May 1.[70] The Georgetown chapter of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine organized a rally calling for his release.[71] In an open letter printed in the university's newspaper, The Hoya, a group of over 130 Jewish students, faculty, staff and alumni, condemned his arrest and detention, saying that ""President Trump is weaponizing Jewish identity, faith and fears of antisemitism as a smokescreen for his authoritarian agenda"".[24][72]

Momodou Taal [ edit ]

Taal is a Cornell University graduate student with dual United Kingdom and Gambian citizenship. On March 22, 2025, he was told to surrender himself at the ICE office in Syracuse, New York. Taal's lawyers, fearing that he would be targeted by the Trump administration, preemptively filed a lawsuit asking a New York federal judge to strike down Executive Orders 14188 and 14161 targeting student protestors. Taal's lawyers have said that he has been surveilled by law enforcement.[73]

Taal faced suspension for allegedly attending a protest at Statler Hotel to shut down a career fair where representatives from Boeing and L3Harris were recruiting. Instead of a suspension, which could have impacted his visa status, university officials chose to ban him from campus. [74]

On March 28, 2025, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Coombe ruled against Taal, saying that his lawyers had neither established that she had jurisdiction to stop the deportation nor shown that there was any clear threat to his constitutional rights that would be addressed by the lawsuit.[75] [76]

On March 31, 2025, Taal announced that he had voluntarily left the United States citing fears for his personal safety. [77]

Jeanette Vizguerra [ edit ]

Vizguerra, an activist for immigrant rights who came to the United States from Mexico in 1993 had obtained multiple stays of deportation under past administrations and gained a national profile in 2017 when she sought refuge from ICE in a Denver church. She was detained by ICE on 17 March 2025.[78] Her apprehension by ICE was denounced by local politicians and organizations including Jared Polis and Mike Johnston as a political persecution and urged ICE to focus on violent offenders, and US District Court Judge Nina Wang blocked her deportation.[79] The Trump administration argued that as a noncitizen, Vizguerra had no legal basis to argue that her detention was politically motivated.[80]

Lynn-Ette & Sons farmworkers [ edit ]

On 2 May 2025, ICE agents pulled over a bus carrying immigrant workers for Lynn-Ette & Sons who had been in a multi-year battle with their employer over unionization. The employees were from Mexico and Guatemala and were all employed as year-round workers. Sources in contact with the workers' families said that the raid ""did not appear to be a broad sweep but rather a targeted enforcement aimed at specific people"" and that the agents had a list of workers they expected to find on the bus. ICE did not identify themselves during the raid, but later confirmed they ha been responsible for the arrests. As of May 5, five of the workers' locations were known while the other nine were unaccounted for. Lynn-Ette & Sons denied any prior knowledge or responsibility for the raid.[81]

Reactions [ edit ]

On April 22, 2025, over 200 higher educational institutions signed a letter pledging to resist Trump's attacks on universities, including the deportation of students. The leaders of a number of prominent universities including Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University signed the letter. Columbia University was initially absent from the list, but signed after it went public.[82]

Some international students are suing the U.S. government after their visas have been cancelled. Many of them say they have never been convicted of a crime.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

The State Department is revoking international student visas over alleged campus activism. But universities report the cancellation extends far beyond these cases, with many other students now facing deportation. Many students tell NPR, their visas were canceled without explanation, raising questions about the true scope and scale of the government's crackdown. NPR's Emily Feng reports.

EMILY FENG, BYLINE: In early April, this undergraduate student from India received an email out of the blue from administrators at the Georgia Institute of Technology, telling him...

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: My visa was revoked on 6 of March, 2025.

FENG: Like all of the students in this story, he asked to be anonymous. The students fear being detained and deported by immigration officials and penalized while looking for jobs in the U.S. He thinks his visa issues date back to a traffic incident from last year, where he says he was falsely accused of driving under the influence.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: The case has now just been completely dismissed. Charges have be dismissed. I have been acquitted.

FENG: He'd come to the U.S. last year to study computer science.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: For someone who's never been there and from an Asian country who always grew up there, the U.S. is kind of, like, one of the best countries in the world. I would love to live there.

FENG: But now he's unsure if he'll be allowed to continue his studies and, even if he can, if he wants to stay in the U.S. According to a tally from the publication Inside Higher Ed of public announcements, over 240 universities have reported more than 1,500 students have had their visas suddenly revoked in this manner, many over minor alleged crimes. These figures likely include some of the 300 or so people Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. revoked visas for due to campus activism. Here's Rubio justifying the move.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARCO RUBIO: I think it's stupid for any country in the world to welcome people into their country that are going to go to your universities as visitors - they're visitors - and say, I'm going to your universities to start a riot.

FENG: The State Department said in a statement to NPR that when revoking visas, they look at arrests, criminal convictions and other conduct, quote, ""inconsistent with the visa classification.""

NPR spoke to and examined the legal cases of more than three dozen international students who had their student visas revoked in March and April. None say they were active in campus activism. Their lawyers say none had ever been convicted of a crime. Some, like this student from China, had faced minor charges once, but all charges were dismissed.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #2: My criminal lawyers say that even though my cases was dismissed and sealed, the federal government still can see, like, all the records in the past.

FENG: And then in at least one case NPR examined, the student says they never had run-ins with the law, and they have no idea why their visa was pulled. Most of the cases NPR reviewed concern Chinese citizens. Others are Taiwanese, Indian and Iranian. It's unclear whether Chinese students have been disproportionately affected by these visa revocations. China is America's biggest geopolitical competitor but also one of the biggest sources of international students. The Department of Homeland Security told NPR in a statement, these visa revocations are, quote, ""nothing new and is part of longstanding protocol and program."" And students typically have 10 days to self-deport.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #3: (Through interpreter) I grew up in mainland China. I didn't know what's democracy, what's freedom of speech. But I knew that they were in the United States.

FENG: This student decided to do her Ph.D. in the U.S. but is facing deportation now over a dispute two years ago with her then-partner. She said she called the police herself because she feared for her safety. But she was charged, though those charges were dismissed. She's asked we even distort her voice because she's scared of retribution for her political views if she's forced to return to China.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #3: (Through interpreter) I can't study, and I can't do my research because I'm scared. What if ICE comes to my home? What if ICE knocks on my door?

FENG: She says she's in shock and not able to sleep well. When she heard President Trump threatened deportations on the campaign trail last year, she said she was disappointed but not scared for herself at the time. She never expected students like her would be targeted.
